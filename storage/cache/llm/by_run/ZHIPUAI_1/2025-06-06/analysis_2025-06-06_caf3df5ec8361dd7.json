7 days, but this aligns with major acquisition news\n- BA shows recovery pattern from recent lows but remains in consolidation phase\n- PG shows 4% decline over 7 days, potentially concerning but within normal ranges\n\nNews Impact Assessment:\n- Critical corporate events requiring fundamental validation:\n  * BA: $1.1B legal settlement to avoid prosecution for 737 MAX crashes\n  * CRM: $8B

Phase III data\n  * UNH: Margin squeeze concerns and regulatory risks\n  * JPM: Bitcoin ETF collateral policy change\n  * IBM: M&A pursuit of Informatica\n\nPosition Risk Analysis:\n- Portfolio
