technical patterns with normal volatility ranges (<3% weekly movements)\n- Notable exception: BA showing strong uptrend of 6.4% in 7 days, potentially signaling breakout\n- CRM showing downtrend of 5.5% requiring investigation\n- Overall portfolio shows low cash ratio (4.8%), indicating near-full investment\n\nNews Impact Assessment:\n- Multiple corporate events requiring fundamental validation:\n  * V: EU regulatory probe into fees (antitrust investigation)\n  * MCD: Major product launch (Snack Wrap return) affecting consumer strategy\n  * UNH: Margin squeeze and regulatory risks in Medicare Advantage\n  * AMGN: Clinical trial results and drug pricing uncertainties\n  * CRM: Security breach incident affecting enterprise credibility\n  * IBM: Strategic AI acquisitions and partnerships\n  * HON: New partnership announcements\n  * BA: Production rate increases and NTSB regulatory hearing\n  * AAPL: DOJ antitrust ruling implications\n  * JNJ: Multiple clinical trial announcements\n\nPosition Risk Analysis:\n- Large positions requiring fundamental review (>7% portfolio allocation):\n  * JNJ: 8.2% of portfolio with recent clinical developments\n  * AMZN: 7.2% with strategic robotics/AI initiatives\n  * TRV: 7.2% stable but large concentration\n  * HON: 6.7% with partnership activities\n  * AXP: 6.6% large financial sector exposure\n\nHistorical Context:\n- Portfolio shows consistent hold strategy with occasional position adjustments\n- Recent increases in AMGN, JNJ, and AAPL indicate active management\n- Decreases in UNH, CRM, and HON suggest risk management activities\n- 68-day holding period across most positions suggests medium-term strategy\n\nPortfolio Concentration Concerns:\n- 5 positions exceed 6.5% allocation threshold requiring fundamental justification\n- Healthcare sector concentration (JNJ, UNH, AMGN) totaling 16.5% of portfolio\n- Technology exposure (MSFT, AMZN, AAPL, IBM, CRM) totaling 23.5%\n</ANALYSIS>\n\n<FILTER_RESULT>\n{\n  \"stocks_need_fundamental\": [\"V\", \"MCD\", \"UNH\", \"AMGN\", \"CRM\", \"IBM\", \"HON\", \"BA\", \"AMZN\", \"AAPL\", \"JNJ\"],\n  \"reasoning\": {\n
