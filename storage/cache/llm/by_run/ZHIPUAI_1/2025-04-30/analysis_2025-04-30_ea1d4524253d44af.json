changes - significant fundamental developments\n- IBM quantum computing investment and earnings results - strategic fundamental event\n- HON dividend announcement - corporate action requiring fundamental context\n- AMZN strategic satellite launch initiative - fundamental business development\n- Multiple stocks facing tariff-related impacts (HD, PG, AAPL) - fundamental economic factor\n\nPosition Risk Management:\n- TRV represents largest position at $6,050.19 (8.0% of portfolio) - concentration risk requires fundamental validation\n- JNJ at $5,774.30 (7.6% of portfolio) -
