normal volatility patterns\n- MSFT displays recovery pattern (+6.4%) after recent weakness, technical stability evident\n- Multiple stocks (HD, V, MCD) show range-bound stable patterns requiring no fundamental validation\n- BA shows significant breakout (+12.6% weekly gain) approaching technical resistance levels\n- UNH exhibits extreme volatility with 22.3% single-day drop, clear technical anomaly requiring fundamental context\n\nNews Impact Assessment:\n- SHW has specific earnings announcements imminent (\"What's in Store for Sherwin-Williams This Earnings Season?\", \"Sherwin-Williams Earnings: What To Look For From SHW\")\n- MCD facing upcoming earnings with key performance measures to watch\n- AMGN affected by significant tariff policy news (\"Trump's Pharma Tariff Plan Could Cost...$51B a Year\")\n- Tech sector (MSFT, AAPL, AMZN) facing tariff discussions for upcoming earnings calls\n\nPosition Risk Evaluation:\n- Portfolio has 22 positions with good diversification\n- Largest positions: TRV ($6,051, 8.1%), JNJ ($5,674, 7.6%), JPM ($5,251, 7.1%)\n- UNH position reduced significantly recently (from $4,477 to $2,510) after major decline\n- All position sizes within reasonable allocation limits (<10% each)\n\nHistorical Context:\n- UNH shows recent aggressive position management (close on 2025-04-21, then increase on 2025-04-24, then decrease on 2025-04-28)\n- BA shows recent position building (increase on 2025-04-24 and 2025-04-25)\n- Most stocks show consistent \"hold\" strategy with minor adjustments\n\nProfessional Criteria Application:\n1. **Technical Anomalies**: UNH's 22.3% drop requires fundamental validation\n2. **News-Driven Events**: SHW earnings, AMGN tariff impact, tech sector tariff concerns\n3. **Position Risk**: No positions exceed critical concentration thresholds\n4. **Valuation Inflection**: BA approaching recent highs, requires fundamental context\n5. **Strategy Consistency**: Historical patterns show technical-first
