"\n<ANALYSIS>\n**Market Signals Analysis:**\n- Most stocks show normal volatility patterns within expected ranges\n- CAT shows moderate upward trend but with volume decline concerns\n- MCD exhibits declining price action with 4% drop over 7 days\n- AAPL displays range-bound trading around WWDC event timing\n- TRV shows declining trend but within normal volatility parameters\n\n**News Impact Assessment:**\n- UNH: Major corporate action ($1B Latin American unit sale) and CEO transition require fundamental validation\n- HON: Multiple acquisitions (Sundyne) and AI product launches represent strategic shifts\n- AAPL: WWDC event represents potential product/service catalyst requiring fundamental assessment\n- PG: Corporate restructuring (7,000 job cuts) indicates strategic realignment\n- JNJ: Regulatory changes (CDC vaccine panel replacement) could impact business fundamentals\n- CAT: Sixth consecutive quarter of volume declines signals business deterioration\n- MCD: Morgan Stanley downgrade citing eroding pricing power and structural headwinds\n\n**Position Risk Analysis:**\n- Large positions (>7% portfolio): HON (7.3%), TRV (7.6%), AXP (7.3%), MSFT (9.3%), AMZN (8.8%), JNJ (8.5%)\n- Extended holding periods (72 days) across most positions suggest periodic fundamental review is prudent\n- Portfolio concentration in financials (GS, JPM, AXP, TRV) and tech (MSFT, AMZN, AAPL) requires sector-level fundamental oversight\n\n**Historical Context:**\n- Recent decrease actions in CAT, MCD, CRM suggest risk management concerns\n- Increase actions in MSFT, AMGN, AMZN indicate confidence in fundamentals\n- Mixed decision patterns suggest selective fundamental dependency\n\n**Professional Criteria Application:**\n- Corporate Actions: UNH (unit sale), HON (acquisitions), PG (job cuts) meet criteria\n- News-Driven Events: AAPL (WWDC), JNJ (regulatory), CAT/MCD (business deterioration) meet criteria\n- Position Risk: Large positions in MSFT, AMZN, JNJ require fundamental justification\n- Strategy Consistency: Recent decrease patterns in CAT/MCD align with fundamental concerns\n</ANALYSIS>\n\n<FILTER_RESULT>\n{\n  \"stocks_need_fundamental\":
