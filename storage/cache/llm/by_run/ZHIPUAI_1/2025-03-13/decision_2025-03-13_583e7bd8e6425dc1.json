Use comprehensive analysis combining technical, fundamental, and news data.\n\n- **Stocks WITHOUT fundamental_data**: These stocks were deemed suitable for technical analysis only. The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\"). Focus analysis on:\n  * Technical indicators and price patterns from market_data\n  * News sentiment and events from news_events  \n  * Position management and risk factors from position_state\n  * Historical decision consistency from history\n\n- **Filter Agent Reasoning**: The filter_reasoning field provides valuable context about the filtering decision.

Average allocation per stock: $4,493.44\n\nKey observations:\n1. High volatility stocks (GS, UNH, AXP, JPM, AAPL) have fundamental data and recent decreases in position sizes\n2. Several stocks (MSFT, HD, AMGN, PG, JNJ) show recent increases in history\n3. BA position is closed\n4. Available cash of $10,815.26 allows for strategic reallocations\n\nRisk Assessment:\n- Multiple financial stocks experiencing policy-driven volatility (tariffs, regulation)\n- UNH facing legal investigation uncertainty\n- AAPL under regulatory pressure\n- GS experiencing corporate governance changes (CEO comments, MD departure)\n\nStrategy:\n1. Maintain current positions on stable technical pattern stocks\n2. Consider selective increases on stocks showing positive momentum (AMGN, PG, JNJ)\n3.
