Use comprehensive analysis combining technical, fundamental, and news data.\n\n- **Stocks WITHOUT fundamental_data**: These stocks were deemed suitable for technical analysis only. The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\"). Focus analysis on:\n  * Technical indicators and price patterns from market_data\n  * News sentiment and events from news_events  \n  * Position management and risk factors from position_state\n  * Historical decision consistency from history\n\n- **Filter Agent Reasoning**: The filter_reasoning field provides valuable context about the filtering decision.

Available cash: $6,612.76, Position value: $87,679.95\n- 23 stocks in portfolio, average allocation ~$4,100 per stock\n- Cash constraint: Any increases must sum ≤ $6,612.76\n- Total assets constraint: All positions must sum ≤ $94,292.71\n\nStock Analysis Summary:\n\n**With Fundamental Data (7 stocks):**\n1. GS: Asia IB restructuring, 4.2% decline - position already reduced, hold\n2. HD: Tariff concerns, 3.8% decline - position size appropriate, hold  \n3. MCD: Dividend announcement + lawsuit, position closed - no compelling re-entry signal, hold\n4. UNH: Extreme volatility from regulatory changes - position recently reopened at conservative size, hold\n5. HON: Positive partnership/guidance news already reflected, hold\n6. BA: Geopolitical risks from Qatar deal, small position appropriate, hold\n7. JNJ: Positive FDA approval already reflected, hold\n\n**Without Fundamental Data (16 stocks):**\nAll show normal technical patterns or minor fluctuations. Most positions are appropriately sized relative to portfolio allocation. No material catalysts warrant position changes given limited cash.\n\nRisk Assessment:\n- Portfolio well-diversified across sectors\n- Largest positions (TRV, JNJ, MSFT) within reasonable limits\n- Cash preservation prudent given mixed market signals\n- No compelling opportunities justify new allocations\n\nDecision Logic:\nMaintain all current positions. The limited cash ($6,612) is better preserved for future opportunities rather than marginal position adjustments in a market with mixed signals. Most risks are already priced in or appropriately managed through position sizing.\n</THINK>\n\n<DECISION>\n{\n  \"decisions\": {\n    \"GS\": {\n      \"action\": \"hold\",\n      \"reasons\": [\n        \"Asia IB business restructuring news already priced in with 4.2% decline from 619.03 to 593.46\",\n        \"Position already reduced from previous highs to conservative $6,318 level\",\n        \"Fundamental metrics reasonable with PE 15.8 and strong dividend yield 198.43%\",\n        \"Filter agent identified corporate restructuring requiring validation, but risks now reflected in price\",\n        \"Maintaining position to preserve capital allocation within total_assets constraint\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.75\n    },\n    \"MSFT\": {\n      \"action\": \"hold\",\n      \"reasons\": [\n        \"Filter agent determined technical patterns sufficient -
