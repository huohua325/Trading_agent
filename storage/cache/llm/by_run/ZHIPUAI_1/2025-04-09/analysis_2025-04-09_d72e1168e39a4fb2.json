"\n<ANALYSIS>\nI'll analyze each stock for fundamental analysis requirements based on technical anomalies, news events, position risk, and portfolio concentration.\n\n**Market Signals Analysis:**\n- Multiple stocks showing extreme volatility with 15-23% drops over 7 days (AAPL 23%, GS 18%, CAT 18%, BA 18%, AXP 16%, HON 15%)\n- These technical anomalies exceed normal volatility patterns and require fundamental validation\n- Most stocks are in clear downtrends with sustained weakness\n\n**News Impact Assessment:**\n- Tariff-related news affecting multiple sectors (tech, industrials, financials)\n- Corporate actions: IBM acquisition, UBS downgrades (SHW, CAT), insider selling (V)\n- Regulatory changes: Medicare payment boosts (UNH), UK privacy battle (AAPL)\n- Sector pressures: Banks under Trump administration, heavy equipment tariff impact\n\n**Position Risk Analysis:**\n- Large positions (>7% portfolio): MSFT (8.3%), PG (8.3%), MCD (7.7%), AMGN (7.5%), JNJ (7.4%)\n- These concentrations require fundamental justification for continued exposure\n- All positions held for 27 days, indicating extended holding period review needed\n\n**Historical Context:**\n- Recent active management on many volatile stocks (GS, CAT, JPM, BA, AMZN)\n- Pattern of decreases on high-volatility stocks suggests fundamental concerns\n- Strategy consistency requires fundamental validation for recent decision changes\n\n**Portfolio Concentration:**\n- Portfolio heavily weighted in stocks experiencing fundamental stress\n- Need to validate continued exposure given market-wide tariff and recession concerns\n</ANALYSIS>\n\n<FILTER_RESULT>\n{\n  \"stocks_need_fundamental\": [\"AAPL\", \"GS\", \"CAT\", \"BA\", \"MSFT\", \"HD\", \"AMZN\", \"JPM\", \"AXP\", \"UNH\", \"CRM\", \"IBM\",
