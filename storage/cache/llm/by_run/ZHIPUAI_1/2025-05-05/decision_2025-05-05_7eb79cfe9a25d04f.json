Use comprehensive analysis combining technical, fundamental, and news data.\n\n- **Stocks WITHOUT fundamental_data**: These stocks were deemed suitable for technical analysis only. The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\"). Focus analysis on:\n  * Technical indicators and price patterns from market_data\n  * News sentiment and events from news_events  \n  * Position management and risk factors from position_state\n  * Historical decision consistency from history\n\n- **Filter Agent Reasoning**: The filter_reasoning field provides valuable context about the filtering decision.

Multiple stocks with suspiciously high dividend yields (all >40%), suggesting data issues - will rely on PE ratios and technicals\n2. Several overvalued stocks (PE >35): MSFT (37.17), AAPL (37.67), IBM (43.0)\n3. Stocks with negative news: MCD (earnings miss), UNH ($200B market loss), AAPL (product shakeup)\n4. Strong momentum stocks: SHW (7.6% gain), HON (6.6% gain), CAT (5.5% gain)\n\nResource allocation strategy:\n- Reduce overvalued positions (MSFT, V, AAPL, IBM)\n- Reduce positions with negative fundamentals (MCD, UNH)\n- Maintain strong performers (SHW, HON, CAT)\n- Keep stable positions (HD, AXP, AMGN, TRV, CRM, JPM, BA, AMZN, PG, GS)\n- Ensure total purchases ≤ $10,367.42 available cash\n- Maintain total position value ≤ $93,384.98\n\nRisk considerations:\n- Concentration risk: V and JNJ are largest positions\n- Valuation risk: High PE stocks need reduction\n- News-driven risk: MCD and UNH have negative business fundamentals\n- Portfolio balance: Need to maintain reasonable allocation across 22 stocks\n</THINK>\n\n<DECISION>\n{\n  \"decisions\": {\n    \"GS\": {\n      \"action\":
