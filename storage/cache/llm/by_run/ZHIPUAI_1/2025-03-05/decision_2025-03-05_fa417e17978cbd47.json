Use comprehensive analysis combining technical, fundamental, and news data.\n\n- **Stocks WITHOUT fundamental_data**: These stocks were deemed suitable for technical analysis only. The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\"). Focus analysis on:\n  * Technical indicators and price patterns from market_data\n  * News sentiment and events from news_events  \n  * Position management and risk factors from position_state\n  * Historical decision consistency from history\n\n- **Filter Agent Reasoning**: The filter_reasoning field provides valuable context about the filtering decision.

Portfolio is nearly fully invested with minimal cash flexibility\n- Several positions exceed typical 5-7% concentration limits (MSFT 10.1%, UNH 9.2%, AMZN 7.9%)\n\nKey Risk Factors:\n1. Concentration risk in large positions\n2. Limited cash for rebalancing or new opportunities\n3. Market volatility with multiple stocks showing recent declines\n4. Fundamental risks in stocks with specific catalysts\n\nStock Analysis Summary:\n\n**High-Risk Large Positions:**\n- MSFT: 10.1% allocation, high P/E 37.17, recent decline\n- UNH: 9.2% allocation, legal investigation creates uncertainty\n- AMZN: 7.9% allocation, high P/E 33.33\n\n**Stocks with Positive Catalysts:**\n- AMGN: Positive Phase 3 TEZSPIRE results, reasonable P/E 23.33\n- AXP: 17% dividend increase, technical anomaly may be overreaction\n- V: 200% YoY Tap to Phone growth, solid fundamentals\n\n**Stocks with Concerns:**\n- GS: 7.2% decline, tariff uncertainty\n- BA: 11.7% decline, though recovery news positive\n- PG: Market share loss to smaller brands\n\n**Stable Positions:**\n- HD, SHW, TRV, JPM, IBM, HON, AAPL, JNJ: Technical patterns adequate, no major concerns\n\nCash Allocation Strategy:\nWith only $987.74 available, must be extremely selective. Best use would be:\n1. Small increase in AMGN (strong catalyst, reasonable valuation)\n2. Small increase in AXP (dividend increase, technical overreaction)\n3. Hold all other positions due to cash constraints\n\nRisk Management:\n- Monitor large positions for potential rebalancing when cash available\n- Maintain current allocations given limited
