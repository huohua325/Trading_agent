Signals Analysis:**\n- **Technical Anomalies Identified**: BA shows exceptional 11.7% decline over 7 days, GS shows 7.2% decline, CRM shows 6.8% decline, and AXP shows 4.1% decline - all exceeding normal volatility ranges and requiring fundamental validation\n- **Volume-Price Patterns**: Recent market-wide declines across Dow components suggest systemic factors, but individual stock movements (particularly BA's sharp drop) indicate stock-specific issues\n- **Momentum Sustainability**: Multiple stocks showing declining trends (MSFT, AMZN, AAPL, CRM) but within normal ranges except for the identified anomalies\n\n**News Impact Assessment:**\n- **Corporate Events with Fundamental Implications**: UNH facing legal investigation (Rosen Law Firm), MCD experiencing supply chain leadership change, AXP announcing 17% dividend increase, AMGN reporting positive Phase 3 trial results\n- **Industry Developments**: V reporting 200% YoY growth in Tap to Phone adoption, BA resuming 737 MAX deliveries to China, PG facing market share loss to smaller brands\n- **Market-Moving News**: GS CEO comments on Trump tariffs creating uncertainty for financial sector exposure\n\n**Position Risk Analysis:**\n- **Large Position Exposure**: MSFT (10.1% of portfolio), UNH (9.2%), AMZN (7.9%) exceed risk management thresholds requiring fundamental justification\n- **Portfolio Concentration**: 3/20 positions exceed 7% allocation, creating concentration risk requiring fundamental validation\n- **Holding Period Considerations**: All positions held for only 2 days, representing recent portfolio initiation with limited performance history\n\n**Historical Context:**\n- **Strategy Consistency**: Recent portfolio rebalancing with all positions initiated simultaneously, confidence levels 0.5-0.85 suggest mixed conviction levels\n- **Risk Management Patterns**: No historical fundamental dependency patterns established due to recent position initiation\n\n**Professional Criteria Application:**\nMultiple stocks meet fundamental analysis requirements through technical anomalies (BA, GS, CRM, AXP), news-driven events (UNH, MCD, AXP, AMGN, V, BA, PG), and position risk management (MSFT, UNH, AMZN).\n</ANALYSIS>\n\n<FILTER_RESULT>\n{\n  \"stocks_need_fundamental\": [\"GS\", \"MSFT\", \"UNH\", \"BA\", \"AXP\", \"AMGN\", \"V\", \"MCD\", \"PG\", \"AMZN\"],\n  \"reasoning\": {\n
