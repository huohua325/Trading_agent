available), indicating position management decisions are critical\n- Most stocks show normal volatility patterns within expected ranges\n- GS shows elevated volatility (5-6% swings) potentially indicating market uncertainty around recent corporate events\n- BA shows notable price movement (178.27 to 163.16) with tariff-related headwinds\n\n**News Impact Assessment:**\n- GS: Major corporate governance changes (new M&A COO), significant $19B Panama Canal acquisition, analyst sell rating - requires fundamental validation\n- MSFT: AI monetization news and growth trajectory analysis needed for large position\n- UNH: False Claims Act case dismissal recommendation, federal budget cut concerns, fiduciary duty investigation - significant regulatory/legal risks\n- AXP: Board changes and 17% dividend increase indicate strategic shifts\n- AMZN: Growth opportunity narrative vs. sell-off analysis needed\n- AAPL: $500B investment effectiveness and AI innovation concerns require fundamental assessment\n- BA: Tariff impacts and defense contract elimination create fundamental uncertainty\n\n**Position Risk Management:**\n- MSFT: $9,884.60 (10.1% of portfolio) - largest position requiring fundamental justification\n- UNH: $9,029.72 (9.3% of portfolio) - second largest with significant legal/regulatory concerns\n- AMZN: $7,665.00 (7.9% of portfolio) - substantial position with growth narrative needing validation\n- Most other positions are 3-6% of portfolio, within normal allocation ranges\n\n**Historical Context:**\n- All positions initiated 3 days ago with recent \"increase\" actions\n- Confidence levels range 0.55-0.85, with BA showing lowest confidence (0.5-0.6)\n- Recent increase decisions suggest portfolio building phase requiring fundamental validation\n\n**Fundamental Analysis Requirements:**\nBased on professional criteria, fundamental analysis is needed for stocks with:\n1. Significant corporate events requiring validation (GS, AXP)\n2. Large position concentrations requiring justification (MSFT, UNH, AMZN)\n3. Major regulatory/legal risks (UNH)\n4.
