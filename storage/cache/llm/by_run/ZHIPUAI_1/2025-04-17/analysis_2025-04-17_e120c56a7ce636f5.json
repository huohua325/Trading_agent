determine if fundamental analysis is required based on technical anomalies, news-driven events, position risk, valuation inflection points, strategy consistency, and portfolio concentration.\n\n**Market Signals Analysis:**\n- Most stocks show moderate volatility within normal ranges (5-10% swings)\n- AAPL shows high volatility (17.5% swing from 172.42 to 202.52) indicating potential technical anomaly\n- BA also shows high volatility (15.4% swing) but position is closed\n- GS shows elevated volatility (11.8% swing) potentially tied to earnings news\n\n**News Impact Assessment:**\n- GS: Major earnings beat, record trading quarter - significant fundamental event\n- CAT: CEO transition announcement - corporate governance change requiring fundamental validation\n- JPM: Record trading revenue, CEO share sales - material financial events\n- CRM: Growth guidance concerns, tariff impact - business outlook issues\n- HON: Analyst sell recommendation - requires fundamental investigation\n- AMZN: Tariff impact analysis on business model - strategic implications\n- AAPL: Tariff relief and manufacturing strategy changes - significant operational impact\n- JNJ: Specific $400M tariff financial impact - quantified fundamental effect\n\n**Position Risk Analysis:**\n- Portfolio total: $90,116.15\n- Largest positions: PG (8.2%), MSFT (8.3%), JNJ (7.5%), MCD (7.4%)\n- All positions are within reasonable allocation limits (<10%)\n- No single position represents excessive concentration risk\n\n**Historical Context:**\n- Most stocks show consistent technical-based decision patterns\n- Recent decisions show confidence levels primarily in 0.65-0.85 range\n- No clear historical fundamental dependency patterns detected\n\n**Portfolio Concentration:**\n- Well-diversified across 21 stocks\n- No overweight positions requiring special fundamental justification\n- Sector diversification appears reasonable\n\n**Final Assessment:**\nBased on the efficiency-first principle, I'm filtering for clear, specific criteria that require fundamental validation. The stocks identified have material corporate events, strategic changes, or quantified financial impacts that technical analysis alone cannot properly assess.\n</ANALYSIS>\n\n<FILTER_RESULT>\n{\n  \"stocks_need_fundamental\": [\"GS\", \"CAT\", \"CRM\", \"JPM\", \"HON\", \"AMZN\", \"AAPL\", \"JNJ\"],\n  \"reasoning\": {\n    \"GS\": \"Major earnings beat and record trading quarter reported in news_events requires fundamental validation of trading business sustainability; elevated 11.8% volatility in close_7d pattern exceeds normal technical analysis reliability\",\n    \"CAT\": \"CEO transition announcement in news_events represents significant corporate governance change requiring fundamental assessment of strategic continuity; recent position increases indicate active management needing validation\",\n    \"CRM\": \"Growth guidance concerns and tariff impact mentioned in news_events require fundamental validation of business outlook; recent position decrease suggests risk management requiring fundamental context\",\n    \"JPM\": \"Record trading revenue and CEO share sales in news_events represent material financial events requiring fundamental analysis of banking business fundamentals; moderate volatility combined with significant corporate actions\",\n    \"HON\": \"Analyst sell recommendation in news_events requires fundamental investigation of underlying business concerns; recent position decreases indicate risk management needing fundamental validation\",\n    \"AMZN\": \"Tariff impact analysis on business model in news_events requires fundamental assessment of operational and financial implications; moderate 11.9% volatility suggests market uncertainty needing validation\",\n    \"AAPL\": \"Tariff relief and manufacturing strategy changes in news_events represent significant operational impact requiring fundamental analysis; high 17.5% volatility in close_7d pattern exceeds technical analysis reliability threshold\",\n    \"JNJ\": \"Specific $400M tariff financial impact quantified in news_events requires fundamental validation of earnings guidance and business resilience; large position (7.5% of portfolio) with material financial impact\",\n    \"MSFT\": \"Technical pattern sufficient: normal 10.1% volatility range, routine market news coverage, position size within normal allocation limits\",\n    \"HD\": \"Technical analysis adequate: stable 6.5% price range, minor news events, position management consistent with technical signals\",\n    \"V\": \"Routine technical signals: normal 8.9% volatility, earnings anticipation news is standard market activity, position size appropriate\",\n    \"SHW\": \"Technical pattern sufficient: moderate 8.8% volatility, routine dividend news, position within normal parameters\",\n    \"MCD\": \"Technical analysis adequate: stable 5.4% price movement, standard market coverage, position management aligns with technical signals\",\n    \"UNH\": \"Normal technical signals: 8.4% volatility within acceptable range, momentum stock mentions are routine sector coverage\",\n    \"AXP\": \"Technical pattern sufficient: despite 13.4% volatility, news events are minimal and technical analysis adequate for position management\",\n    \"AMGN\": \"Routine technical signals: stable 5.4% volatility, market index impact mentions are standard market activity\",\n    \"TRV\": \"Technical analysis adequate: stable 6.8% price range, earnings beat mentioned but minor significance for fundamental analysis\",\n    \"IBM\": \"Technical pattern sufficient: normal 8.9% volatility, competitive analysis news is routine sector coverage\",\n    \"HON\": \"Technical analysis adequate: moderate 9.5% volatility, analyst downgrade noted but position management can rely on technical signals\",\n    \"BA\": \"Position closed: no current exposure requiring fundamental analysis despite high volatility and trade war news\",\n    \"PG\": \"Technical pattern sufficient: stable 6.8% volatility, defensive consumer staple with routine dividend coverage\",\n    \"JNJ\": \"Technical analysis adequate: stable 2.9% volatility, despite tariff impact news, position management can rely on technical signals\"\n  }\n}\n</FILTER_RESULT>"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 15912, "completion_tokens": 2938, "total_tokens": 18850}}, "parsed_response_length": 3335, "raw_response_length": 6318}}
