Use comprehensive analysis combining technical, fundamental, and news data.\n\n- **Stocks WITHOUT fundamental_data**: These stocks were deemed suitable for technical analysis only. The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\"). Focus analysis on:\n  * Technical indicators and price patterns from market_data\n  * News sentiment and events from news_events  \n  * Position management and risk factors from position_state\n  * Historical decision consistency from history\n\n- **Filter Agent Reasoning**: The filter_reasoning field provides valuable context about the filtering decision.

$86,887.61\n- Number of Stocks: 22\n- Average Allocation per Stock: $4,363.87\n\n**Cash Constraints:**\n- Maximum additional buying: $9,097.46 (available_cash)\n- Total position target must not exceed $95,985.08\n\n**Portfolio Risk Assessment:**\n- Concentration: Well diversified across 22 stocks\n- Sector exposure: Banking (GS, JPM), Tech (MSFT, AAPL, CRM, IBM), Industrial (CAT, BA, HON), Healthcare (JNJ, UNH, AMGN), Consumer (HD, MCD, PG, AXP, AMZN)\n- Position sizes: Generally balanced around $4K-$6K target, with some smaller positions\n\n## Stock Analysis\n\n### High Conviction Opportunities (Fundamental Data Available):\n\n**JNJ**: Strong fundamental case with positive Phase 3 lung cancer trial results, reasonable P/E 18.75, high dividend yield 294.48%. Current position $6,558.32 could be increased within portfolio allocation limits.\n\n**GS**: Mixed signals - reasonable valuation (P/E 15.8) but banking sector weakness and high volatility in recent trading. Maintain current position.\n\n**MSFT**: Strategic concerns with data center abandonment, but still solid franchise. High valuation (P/E 37.17) suggests caution. Hold.\n\n**BA**: High risk with criminal fraud trial in June and fundamental uncertainty. Small position ($1,493.10) appropriate, maintain minimal exposure.\n\n**AAPL**: China sales slump concerns but potential $1B AI infrastructure order could be positive catalyst. Current small position ($2,001.68) reasonable, hold.\n\n### Technical Analysis Stocks (Stable Positions):\n\n**HD, V, CAT, MCD, UNH, AXP, AMGN, TRV, CRM, JPM, IBM, HON, AMZN, PG, SHW**: All showing stable patterns with no material catalysts requiring position changes. Most positions are within reasonable allocation ranges.\n\n## Risk-First Decision Logic\n\n**Primary Risk Factors:**\n1. Banking sector weakness (GS, JPM) - hold positions, avoid adding\n2. Tech valuation concerns (MSFT, AAPL) - maintain but don't increase\n3. Legal/corporate governance risk (BA) - keep minimal exposure\n4. Portfolio concentration - maintain diversification\n\n**Cash Allocation Strategy:**\n- Available: $9,097.46\n- Target: Increase JNJ position by ~$3,000 (within average allocation target)\n- Remaining cash: Keep as buffer for opportunities\n\n**Position Size Management:**\n- Average target: ~$4,363 per stock\n- JNJ currently at $6,558 (above average but reasonable given strength)\n- Most other positions $4K-$6K range (appropriate)\n\n## Final Decisions\n\n**Increase**: JNJ - strong fundamental catalyst, reasonable valuation, within portfolio limits\n**Hold**: All other positions - no compelling reasons for changes, maintaining risk balance\n**Close**: None - all positions serving portfolio diversification purpose\n\nTotal cash used: $3,000 (well within $9,097.46 available)\nNew total assets: $98,985.08 (within $95,985.08 limit - error in calculation, need to adjust)\n\nCorrection: With $3,000 increase to JNJ, total would be $98,985.08 which exceeds $95,985.08 limit. Need to reduce increase to $3,000 or less.\n\nActually, let me recalculate: Current total $95,985.08 + $3,000 increase = $98,985.08 > limit of $95,985.08. This is wrong.\n\nThe constraint is that total position value cannot exceed $95,985.08. Current position value is $86,887.61, so maximum additional is $95,985.08 - $86,887.61 = $9,097.46 (which matches available cash).\n\nSo increasing JNJ by $3,000 would make total $89,887.61 + $3,000 = $92,887.61, which is within the $95,985.08 limit. This is acceptable.\n\nWait, let me be more careful:\n- Current position value: $86,887.61\n- Available cash: $9,097.46  \n- Total assets: $95,985.08\n\nIf I increase JNJ by $3,000:\n- New position value: $86,887.61 + $3,000 = $89,887.61\n- New available cash: $9,097.46 - $3,000 = $6,097.46\n- New total assets: $89,887.61 + $6,097.46 = $95,985.08 ✓\n\nThis works perfectly within constraints.\n</THINK>\n\n<DECISION>\n{\n  \"decisions\": {\n    \"GS\": {\n      \"action\": \"hold\",\n      \"reasons\": [\n        \"Banking sector weakness with Jefferies profit misses requires
