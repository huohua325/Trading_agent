normal volatility patterns within expected ranges\n- GS exhibits notable volatility with a 5% swing from peak to trough in close_7d pattern\n- BA shows moderate volatility around $180 level with some price instability\n- MSFT, AMZN, JNJ, PG represent larger portfolio positions (~7.5% each) requiring closer monitoring\n\nNews Impact Assessment:\n- MSFT: Material corporate action news about abandoning data center projects due to oversupply - significant strategic shift in AI infrastructure\n- BA: Multiple material news items including criminal fraud trial date, defense contract wins, and analyst battles - high fundamental uncertainty\n- JNJ: Positive Phase 3 lung cancer drug trial results - material clinical development milestone\n- GS: Sector-specific banking news with Jefferies profit misses and Goldman's gold forecast changes - industry context needed\n- AMZN: AI shopping tool introduction and analyst commentary on AI/economic resilience - strategic developments\n- AAPL: China sales slump concerns and potential $1B Nvidia server order - regional market and infrastructure strategy\n\nPosition Risk Analysis:\n- Portfolio concentration: No single position exceeds 8% threshold, but 4 stocks (MSFT, AMZN, PG, JNJ) are at ~7.5% - monitoring level\n- All positions held for 19 days - consistent holding period across portfolio\n- BA position reduced significantly in recent days (from $4,000 to $1,500) suggesting risk management concerns\n\nHistorical Context:\n- Recent decrease actions on BA, AAPL, AMGN, UNH indicate risk management stance\n- Increase actions on MSFT, JPM, HON, AMZN suggest confidence in these positions\n- BA shows high volatility in decision history with multiple increases/decreases\n\nFundamental Analysis Requirements:\nBased on professional criteria, stocks requiring fundamental validation are those with material corporate events, clinical developments, or significant strategic shifts that technical analysis alone cannot properly assess.\n</ANALYSIS>\n\n<FILTER_RESULT>\n{\n  \"stocks_need_fundamental\": [\"MSFT\", \"BA\", \"JNJ\", \"GS\", \"AAPL\"],\n  \"reasoning\": {\n    \"MSFT\": \"Material corporate action:
