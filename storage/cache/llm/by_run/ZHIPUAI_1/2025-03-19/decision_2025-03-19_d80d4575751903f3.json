Use comprehensive analysis combining technical, fundamental, and news data.\n\n- **Stocks WITHOUT fundamental_data**: These stocks were deemed suitable for technical analysis only. The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\"). Focus analysis on:\n  * Technical indicators and price patterns from market_data\n  * News sentiment and events from news_events  \n  * Position management and risk factors from position_state\n  * Historical decision consistency from history\n\n- **Filter Agent Reasoning**: The filter_reasoning field provides valuable context about the filtering decision.

$94,802.6 (hard limit for all positions)\n- Available cash: $15,546.16 (limit for new purchases)\n- Current position value: $79,256.44\n- 22 stocks in portfolio, average allocation ~$4,309 per stock\n\nKey considerations:\n1. Need to maintain diversification across 22 positions\n2. Several stocks with strong fundamental catalysts requiring attention\n3. Technical patterns showing mixed signals across the portfolio\n4. Cash constraints require selective allocation\n\nStock-by-Stock Analysis:\n\n**With Fundamental Data (Deep Analysis Required):**\n\nGS ($551.78): Fed regulatory changes with Bowman appointment could impact banking profitability. PE 15.8 is reasonable, strong dividend yield 198.43%. 7-day trend shows recovery from $524.81 to $551.78 (+5.2%). Current position small ($2,031), represents undervalued opportunity.\n\nMSFT ($383.52): Mini-tender offer by TRC Capital requires validation. PE 37.17 high but justified for cloud leader. 7-day stable around $380-388 range. Current position well-sized ($5,983).\n\nUNH ($503.80): Strong buy recommendation with technical uptrend from $480 to $503 (+4.9%). PE 14.92 reasonable, dividend yield 254.25% excellent. Healthcare defensive qualities.\n\nAMGN ($318.65): Positive Uplizna clinical data is significant catalyst. PE 23.33 reasonable for pharma, strong dividend yield 331.93%. 7-day stable around $312-327.\n\nBA ($161.57): Supply chain fire and SpaceX partnership issues. Recent recovery from $148 to $161 (+9.1%) but still well below 52-week high $242.69. No position currently - high risk/reward.\n\nAAPL ($212.69): 7.8% decline from $227 to $209 exceeds technical reliability threshold. AI delay concerns fundamental. PE 37.67 high, current position $3,012.\n\n**Without Fundamental Data (Technical Focus):**\n\nHD ($349.57): 6.7% decline within normal range, demographic silver tsunami tailwind long-term. Technical recovery from $347 to $349.\n\nV ($334.77): Routine business updates, stable technical pattern. 7-day range $328-341, currently mid-range.\n\nSHW ($335.53): Post-earnings weakness but chemicals symposium upcoming. 7-day decline from $357 to $335 (-6.2%).\n\nCAT ($336.71): Options trading focus, stable range. 7-day flat around $333-345.\n\nMCD ($303.60): Analyst upgrade to Buy, defensive consumer stock. Stable technical pattern.\n\nAXP ($262.72): Loan performance metrics normal, small position $1,786 appropriate for technical management.\n\nTRV ($260.50): Minimal news, stable pattern suitable for hold.\n\nCRM ($278.73): Market sell-off creates opportunity, billionaire interest noted. 7-day stable $272-284.\n\nJPM ($234.97): Routine commentary, stable pattern.\n\nIBM ($246.95): Quantum computing long-term, current technical adequate.\n\nHON ($209.74): Credit agreement routine, position size $4,921 appropriate.\n\nAMZN ($192.82): AI growth priced in, stable technical pattern.\n\nPG ($167.71): Consumer staples stability, large position $6,481 justified.\n\nJNJ ($164.25): Healthcare stability, large position $6,574 justified.\n\nResource Allocation Strategy:\n- Prioritize undervalued opportunities (GS, UNH, AMGN)\n- Reduce overvalued positions (AAPL)\n- Maintain defensive core (PG, JNJ, MCD)\n- Consider speculative BA position given recovery potential\n- Ensure cash
