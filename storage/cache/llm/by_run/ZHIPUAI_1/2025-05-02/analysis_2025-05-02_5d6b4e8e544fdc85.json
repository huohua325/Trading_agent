425.4 in close_7d, indicating unusual volatility requiring fundamental validation\n- Most other stocks show stable technical patterns within normal ranges\n- GS, V, and BA show moderate uptrends but within normal volatility parameters\n\nNews Impact Assessment:\n- MSFT: Multiple earnings-related articles including \"surprising earnings sends stock surging\" and \"strong growth in revenue and earnings\"\n- V: Earnings beat and $30B stock buyback announcement are material corporate actions\n- AAPL: Significant regulatory news with App Store court ruling violation\n- JNJ: FDA approval for new drug (IMAAVY) represents material regulatory development\n- BA: Tariff-related news affecting airline customers and potential Chinese competition\n- AMZN: Earnings coverage and $4B rural investment announcement\n- HON: Earnings beat and dividend announcement\n- AMGN: Earnings-related coverage and potential beat expectations\n- GS: Earnings call commentary and floating rate notes redemption\n\nPosition Risk Evaluation:\n- All positions remain under 10% portfolio allocation threshold\n- Largest positions: JNJ (7.4%), BA (7.2%), GS (7.3%) - within normal limits\n- No positions require fundamental review solely based on size\n\nHistorical Context:\n- Most stocks show consistent \"hold\" patterns with occasional increases/decreases\n- No clear fundamental-dependent decision patterns emerge from history\n- Recent increases in MSFT, V, CAT, BA, AAPL suggest active management but not necessarily fundamental dependency\n\nConclusion: Stocks with material news events (earnings, regulatory actions, corporate actions) and technical anomalies require fundamental validation for sound decision-making.\n</ANALYSIS>\n\n<FILTER_RESULT>\n{\n  \"stocks_need_fundamental\":
