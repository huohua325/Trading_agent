Signals Analysis:\n- GS shows moderate volatility with price swings between 593-615, but no extreme technical anomalies requiring immediate concern\n- MSFT, HD, V, SHW, CAT, MCD, HON, JNJ exhibit stable technical patterns within normal volatility ranges\n- UNH shows notable volatility with a sharp drop from 321.58 to 296.67, but has since stabilized - technical analysis adequate\n- CRM shows higher volatility (288.06 to 266.92) but pattern appears driven by earnings anticipation rather than technical breakdown\n\nNews Impact Assessment:\n- GS: Significant fundamental concerns with Moody's US credit downgrade and 1MDB scandal sentencing - requires fundamental validation\n- TRV: Major corporate event - $2.4 billion sale of Canadian operations to Definity - requires fundamental analysis\n- CRM: Earnings announcement tomorrow and potential $8 billion Informatica acquisition - fundamental critical\n- AAPL: Trade tensions and potential OS rebranding but no immediate fundamental catalysts\n- AXP: Consumer confidence news is market sentiment, not fundamental driver\n- JPM: Credit rating concerns similar to GS but less material impact\n\nPosition Risk Management:\n- Portfolio shows concentration risk with JNJ ($8,072, 8.8%), HON ($7,575, 8.2%), MSFT ($7,677, 8.3%), and TRV ($7,020, 7.6%)\n- Extended holding periods (64 days for most positions) suggest routine portfolio maintenance, not active trading\n- Position sizes are substantial but within reasonable allocation limits\n\nHistorical Context:\n- Recent decisions show consistent \"hold\" strategy with occasional rebalancing\n- No history of fundamental-dependent decisions for most stocks\n- Strategy appears technically-driven with selective fundamental validation\n\nPortfolio Concentration Analysis:\n- Top 4 positions (JNJ, HON, MSFT, TRV) represent 33% of portfolio - within acceptable diversification limits\n- No single position exceeds risk thresholds that would automatically trigger fundamental review\n</ANALYSIS>\n\n<FILTER_RESULT>\n{\n  \"stocks_need_fundamental\": [\"GS\", \"TRV\", \"CRM\"],\n  \"reasoning\": {\n    \"GS\": \"Moody's US credit downgrade and 1MDB scandal sentencing create
