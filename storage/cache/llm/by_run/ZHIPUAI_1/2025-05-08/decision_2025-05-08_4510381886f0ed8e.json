Use comprehensive analysis combining technical, fundamental, and news data.\n\n- **Stocks WITHOUT fundamental_data**: These stocks were deemed suitable for technical analysis only. The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\"). Focus analysis on:\n  * Technical indicators and price patterns from market_data\n  * News sentiment and events from news_events  \n  * Position management and risk factors from position_state\n  * Historical decision consistency from history\n\n- **Filter Agent Reasoning**: The filter_reasoning field provides valuable context about the filtering decision.

Position distribution shows good diversification across sectors\n- Need to identify fundamental weaknesses and adjust accordingly\n\nKey Findings:\n1. MCD shows fundamental deterioration with Q1 earnings miss and 3.5% revenue decline\n2. Most other positions are appropriately sized with stable technical patterns\n3. Several stocks have strong dividend support providing downside protection\n4. Available cash sufficient for strategic adjustments\n\nRisk Assessment:\n- Concentration risk minimal (largest position JNJ at 7% of portfolio)\n- Sector diversification adequate across financials, tech, industrials, consumer\n- Legal/operational risks identified in UNH (already closed position)\n- Trade tensions affecting BA and AMZN but positions already managed\n\nDecision Logic:\n- Reduce MCD exposure due to fundamental earnings weakness\n- Hold all other positions as they show appropriate sizing and stable patterns\n- Preserve capital for better opportunities while maintaining current
