Use comprehensive analysis combining technical, fundamental, and news data.\n\n- **Stocks WITHOUT fundamental_data**: These stocks were deemed suitable for technical analysis only. The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\"). Focus analysis on:\n  * Technical indicators and price patterns from market_data\n  * News sentiment and events from news_events  \n  * Position management and risk factors from position_state\n  * Historical decision consistency from history\n\n- **Filter Agent Reasoning**: The filter_reasoning field provides valuable context about the filtering decision. Consider this reasoning when making your final investment decision, as it reflects professional risk assessment about data requirements.\n</DUAL-AGENT CONTEXT>\n\n<OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS>\n1. <THINK>: Analysis process  \n   - Portfolio: Position distribution, risk diversification  \n   - Cash flow: Increases must be ≤ total_assets   \n   - **CRITICAL RESOURCE ALLOCATION**: \n     * Total available assets: {total_assets} - this is your HARD LIMIT\n     * Number of stocks to decide: {stock_count} - ensure balanced allocation\n     * Average allocation per stock: {total_assets/stock_count} - use as reference\n     * Never exceed total_assets in aggregate decisions\n   - Stocks: Adapt analysis depth based on available data\n     * **With fundamental_data**: Complete analysis using market_data, fundamental_data, news_events, position_state, and filter_reasoning\n     * **Without fundamental_data**: Focus on market_data patterns, news_events sentiment, position_state management, and filter_reasoning context\n     * Market Data: Price trends and momentum from market_data.close_7d, current price  \n     * Fundamental Indicators (when available): Valuation (pe_ratio), size (market_cap), income (dividend metrics), momentum (week_52 indicators)  \n     * News & Events: Sentiment and catalysts from news_events.top_k_events  \n   - Risk: Identify major risk factors, assess portfolio-wide  \n     * Technical risks: volatility, momentum breaks (from market_data)\n     * Fundamental risks (when available): valuation risk (high pe_ratio), momentum risk (week_52_high/low), size concentration  \n     * News risks: event-driven volatility\n   - Decision logic: Combine opportunities with cash limits and stock count constraints\n   - History: Maintain strategy consistency  \n   - Filter Context: Leverage filter_reasoning to understand analysis depth rationale\n   - Must cover ALL stocks, none can be skipped  \n\n2. <DECISION>:  \nFinal decision requirements:  \n- Output must be strictly valid JSON inside <DECISION> tags, all strings use double quotes, correct syntax, and no explanation/Markdown.  \n- Must provide a decision for every stock in the input symbols; no omissions, no additions.

average allocation should be ~$4,529 per stock\n- Portfolio shows concentration in financial services (GS, V, AXP, JPM) and tech (MSFT, AMZN, AAPL)\n- Recent market stress from tariffs affecting multiple positions\n\nRisk Assessment:\n- High volatility stocks: BA (15.5% decline), CAT (10.7% decline), GS (9.2% decline)\n- Legal/Regulatory risks: UNH (DOJ case), JPM (Charlie Javice), IBM (discrimination), BA (DOJ plea)\n- Tariff exposure: AMZN, AAPL directly affected\n- Large positions requiring monitoring: MSFT (8.5%), JNJ (7.3%), JPM/V (6.2% each)\n\nTechnical Analysis:\n- Sharp declines in BA, CAT, GS, AXP suggest short-term technical weakness\n- Defensive stability in PG, AMGN, HON\n- Extended holding periods (24 days) across all positions suggest portfolio rebalancing needed\n\nFundamental Analysis (where available):\n- Strong dividend yields: GS (198.43%), MCD (233.52%), UNH (254.25%), JNJ (294.48%)\n- Reasonable valuations: TRV (PE 11.85), UNH (PE 14.92), GS (PE 15.8)\n- High growth stocks with elevated PE: MSFT (37.17), CRM (35.46), AAPL (37.67)\n\nDecision Strategy:\n1. Reduce exposure to high-risk/volatile stocks (BA, CAT)\n2. Maintain defensive positions (PG, JNJ, UNH)\n3. Trim overextended positions (MSFT, JPM, V)\n4. Add to fundamentally strong but technically depressed stocks (GS)\n5. Preserve cash for future opportunities given market uncertainty\n\nCash Constraints:\n- Available cash: $10,622.71\n- Must ensure total target positions ≤ $90,584\n- Balanced allocation required
