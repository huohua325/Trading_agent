$90,871.07\n- 22 stocks to manage, average allocation: $4,409.06 per stock\n- Need to balance opportunities with cash constraints\n\nKey observations:\n1. Portfolio is well-diversified across sectors\n2. Several stocks with fundamental data show positive catalysts (CAT dividend increase, AMGN clinical success)\n3. Some stocks facing challenges (MCD lawsuit, UNH settlement, BA safety concerns)\n4. Limited cash available requires selective allocation\n\nCash allocation strategy:\n- Focus on highest conviction opportunities with fundamental catalysts\n- Maintain positions in stable performers\n- Reduce exposure to stocks facing material risks\n- Total increases must not exceed $6,128.26 available cash\n\nRisk assessment:\n- Technical volatility in several names (V, SHW, BA)\n- Legal/regulatory risks (MCD, UNH, BA)\n- Market sentiment shifts (AAPL, CRM)\n- Strong fundamentals supporting CAT, AMGN, JNJ\n\nDecision logic:\n1. Increase positions in stocks with positive fundamental catalysts and reasonable valuations\n2. Hold stable performers with adequate technical patterns\n3. Reduce exposure to stocks facing material risks or overvaluations\n4.
