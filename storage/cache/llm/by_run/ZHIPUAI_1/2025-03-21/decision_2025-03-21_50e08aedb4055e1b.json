Use comprehensive analysis combining technical, fundamental, and news data.\n\n- **Stocks WITHOUT fundamental_data**: These stocks were deemed suitable for technical analysis only. The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\"). Focus analysis on:\n  * Technical indicators and price patterns from market_data\n  * News sentiment and events from news_events  \n  * Position management and risk factors from position_state\n  * Historical decision consistency from history\n\n- **Filter Agent Reasoning**: The filter_reasoning field provides valuable context about the filtering decision.

Available cash: $10,155.23, Position value: $84,501.20\n- 22 stocks require decisions, average allocation ~$4,302 per stock\n- Cash constraint: sum of positive cash changes ≤ $10,155.23\n- Total assets constraint: sum of all target amounts ≤ $94,656.43\n\nCritical Assessment:\n1. **Stocks with fundamental_data (8 stocks)**: Require comprehensive analysis\n   - GS: Mixed news (M&A downgrade vs AI/blockchain positives), reasonable PE 15.8, strong 7-day uptrend +5%\n   - HD: High PE 27.69 but positive business developments (KILZ exclusive, AI tools)\n   - MCD: Stable uptrend +2.5%, moderate PE 25.81, competitive pressure from Yum China\n   - UNH: Strong uptrend +6.3%, attractive PE 14.92, positive regulatory changes\n   - AMGN: Biosimilar threat but reasonable PE 23.33, stable trading\n   - JPM: Strong uptrend +4.9%, 12% dividend increase signals confidence, reasonable PE 15.3\n   - BA: Technical bounce +8.8% but safety incident creates risk, PE 0.0 (losses)\n   - JNJ: FDA Fast Track positive, reasonable PE 18.75, very stable trading\n\n2. **Stocks without fundamental_data (14 stocks)**: Technical analysis focus\n   - Most showing stable patterns with normal volatility\n   - No material catalysts requiring position changes\n   - Current allocations appear reasonable relative to portfolio\n\nKey Decision Factors:\n- JPM's dividend increase is a clear positive fundamental signal\n- BA's safety incident creates material risk despite technical bounce\n- Other positions show balanced risk/reward with no compelling reasons for major changes\n- Portfolio already well-diversified across sectors\n\nCash Allocation Strategy:\n- Increase JPM by ~$978 (to $5,000) based on dividend strength\n- Decrease BA by ~$1,082 (to $1,000) due to safety concerns\n- Net cash impact: -$104 (frees up cash)\n- All other positions: HOLD to maintain strategy consistency\n\nThis approach respects cash constraints, addresses clear fundamental signals, and maintains portfolio
