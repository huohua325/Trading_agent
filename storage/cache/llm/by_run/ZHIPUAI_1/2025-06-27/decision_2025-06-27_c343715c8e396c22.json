GS: Banking regulatory rollback creates fundamental model uncertainty - need position reduction\n2. JNJ: Talc litigation ongoing with $8M verdict - reduce exposure given 8.76% concentration\n3. UNH: DOJ investigation into PBM unit - reduce position due to regulatory risk\n4. MSFT: AI partnership tensions with OpenAI - maintain current reduced position\n5. CRM: Agentforce 3 launch requires fundamental validation - maintain small position\n\nOpportunities:\n1. AXP: Strong technical momentum with 6.3% gain, solid fundamentals\n2.
