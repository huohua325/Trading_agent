The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\").

Analysis:\n- Total assets: $96,565.29 with 22 stocks (avg allocation ~$4,389)\n- Available cash: $8,250.88 for new allocations\n- Position value: $88,314.41\n\nKey Portfolio Risks:\n1. **GS** (11.3% concentration) approaching 52-week highs with defensive positioning news\n2. **CAT** (10.8% concentration) at technical breakout point\n3. **MSFT** (7.7% position) with AI strategy shifts and layoffs\n4. **UNH** recently closed after extreme 17% decline\n5. **BA** facing 737 MAX legal prosecution\n\nStocks with fundamental_data require deep analysis due to:\n- Large concentrations (GS, CAT, MSFT)\n- Corporate events (MSFT layoffs, BA legal issues, AAPL patent trial)\n- Partnership uncertainties (MCD-Krispy Kreme)\n- Extreme technical anomalies (UNH 17% drop)\n\nStocks without fundamental_data are suitable for technical-only analysis based on stable patterns and normal volatility.\n\nResource Allocation Strategy:\n- 22 stocks require balanced management\n- Average allocation ~$4,389 provides reference point\n- Cash constraint: $8,250.88 for increases\n- Must maintain diversification while managing concentration risks\n\nTechnical Analysis Summary:\n- Strong momentum: GS, CAT, MSFT, HD, V, TRV, IBM, HON\n- Stable patterns: AXP, AMGN, CRM, JPM, PG, JNJ\n- Concerning: UNH (extreme decline), SHW (minor fluctuations)\n- Mixed: BA (stable but legal risk), AAPL (near 52-week high), AMZN (stable range)\n\nDecision Logic:\n1. Reduce high-concentration positions (GS, CAT) to manage portfolio risk\n2. Close or reduce positions with material corporate risks (BA, MCD)\n3. Maintain stable technical performers (HD, V, TRV, etc.)\n4. Reallocate freed cash to strengthen core positions\n5.
