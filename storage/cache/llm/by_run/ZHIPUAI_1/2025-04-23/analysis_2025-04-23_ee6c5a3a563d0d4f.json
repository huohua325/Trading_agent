Let me evaluate systematically:\n\n**Market Signals Analysis:**\n- Most stocks show normal volatility patterns within expected ranges\n- UNH shows extreme volatility (28.8% decline from 599.47 to 427.18) - a clear technical anomaly requiring fundamental validation\n- MSFT shows significant decline (5.6%) with high volatility patterns\n- Other stocks show relatively normal price movements\n\n**News Impact Assessment:**\n- MSFT: Antitrust case against peer (Alphabet) and AI-related concerns are market-moving events requiring fundamental context\n- SHW: Upcoming earnings report next week requires fundamental validation\n- BA: Major corporate action - $10.6 billion Jeppesen unit sale to Thoma Bravo\n- AMZN: Tariff headwinds and AI monetization concerns from analyst downgrade\n- AAPL: China sales decline and analyst downgrade\n- HD: Tariff concerns from Trump meeting with retailers\n- IBM: Q1 earnings on horizon with valuation concerns\n\n**Position Risk Analysis:**\n- Largest positions: PG (8.9%), TRV (8.8%), JPM (7.5%), MSFT (6%), GS (6.9%), HD (6.7%), MCD (6.6%)\n- All positions are within reasonable allocation limits (<10%)\n- No positions exceed portfolio concentration thresholds requiring mandatory fundamental review\n\n**Historical Context:**\n- Most positions held for 37 days with consistent hold/rebalance patterns\n- UNH was recently closed (April 21) after extreme volatility\n- No clear patterns of fundamental dependency in historical decisions\n\n**Professional Criteria Application:**\n- Technical Anomalies: UNH qualifies with extreme 28.8% gap movement\n- News-Driven Events: MSFT, SHW, BA, AMZN, AAPL, HD, IBM qualify\n- Position Risk Management: No positions exceed thresholds\n- Valuation Inflection Points: Not applicable based on available data\n- Strategy Consistency: No clear patterns requiring fundamental dependency\n- Portfolio Concentration: All positions within normal limits\n\nThe efficiency principle suggests defaulting to technical analysis unless clear criteria are met. The identified stocks have specific, data-driven reasons requiring fundamental validation.\n</ANALYSIS>\n\n<FILTER_RESULT>\n{\n  \"stocks_need_fundamental\": [\"MSFT\", \"SHW\", \"UNH\", \"BA\", \"AMZN\", \"AAPL\", \"HD\", \"IBM\"],\n  \"reasoning\": {\n    \"MSFT\": \"Antitrust case against peer and AI-related concerns in news_events require fundamental validation; 5.6% decline with high volatility exceeds technical analysis reliability\",\n    \"SHW\": \"Upcoming earnings report next week requires fundamental validation for earnings expectations and valuation assessment\",\n    \"UNH\": \"Extreme technical anomaly with 28.8% decline from 599.47 to 427.18 represents gap movement requiring fundamental investigation of business drivers\",\n    \"BA\": \"Major corporate action - $10.6 billion Jeppesen unit sale to Thoma Bravo requires fundamental analysis of deal impact and strategic implications\",\n    \"AMZN\": \"News-driven tariff headwinds and AI monetization concerns from analyst downgrade require fundamental business impact assessment\",\n    \"AAPL\": \"China sales decline and analyst downgrade reported in news_events require fundamental validation of international business health\",\n    \"HD\": \"Trump meeting with retailers regarding tariff concerns represents fundamental business risk requiring analysis of supply chain impact\",\n    \"IBM\": \"Q1 earnings on horizon with valuation concerns mentioned in news_events requires fundamental earnings validation\",\n    \"GS\": \"Technical pattern sufficient: stable 5.2% uptrend, normal volatility, position size within allocation limits\",\n    \"V\": \"Technical analysis adequate: minor 0.6% decline, stable pattern, no material news catalysts\",\n    \"CAT\": \"Routine technical signals: minor 0.8% decline, normal volatility, standard position management adequate\",\n    \"MCD\": \"Technical pattern sufficient: volatile but stable overall, defensive qualities noted but no fundamental red flags\",\n    \"AXP\": \"Technical analysis adequate: minor price movement, no significant news events, position within normal limits\",\n    \"AMGN\": \"Technical pattern sufficient: moderate 2.6% decline within normal range, no material news catalysts\",\n    \"TRV\": \"Technical analysis adequate: strong 6.6% uptrend with normal volatility, position size acceptable\",\n    \"CRM\": \"Technical pattern sufficient: moderate 4.5% decline, analyst downgrades noted but position size small\",\n    \"JPM\": \"Technical analysis adequate: minor 0.3% decline, investor day noted but not requiring immediate fundamental review\",\n    \"HON\": \"Technical pattern sufficient: stable performance, earnings expectations noted but no immediate fundamental concerns\",\n    \"PG\": \"Technical analysis adequate: minor 0.6% gain, large position (8.9%) but stable pattern with no material news\",\n    \"JNJ\": \"Technical pattern sufficient: moderate 4% gain, medical data noted but position management adequate\"\n  }\n}\n</FILTER_RESULT>"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 16031, "completion_tokens": 3037, "total_tokens": 19068}}, "parsed_response_length": 2654, "raw_response_length": 5202}}
