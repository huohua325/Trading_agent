Use comprehensive analysis combining technical, fundamental, and news data.\n\n- **Stocks WITHOUT fundamental_data**: These stocks were deemed suitable for technical analysis only. The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\"). Focus analysis on:\n  * Technical indicators and price patterns from market_data\n  * News sentiment and events from news_events  \n  * Position management and risk factors from position_state\n  * Historical decision consistency from history\n\n- **Filter Agent Reasoning**: The filter_reasoning field provides valuable context about the filtering decision.

stocks, average allocation ~$4,153 per stock\n- Concentration risks: TRV (9.2%), PG (7.8%), JNJ (7.4%), JPM (7.0%) exceed normal allocation\n- Recent events: UNH 22% crash on earnings miss, BA earnings beat with uncertainty\n\nKey stock analysis:\n1. **GS**: Corporate governance issues ($160M zero-performance bonuses) offset strong technical uptrend\n2. **UNH**: Critical earnings miss with class action investigation, extreme volatility requires fundamental assessment\n3. **TRV**: Largest position at 9.2% with solid fundamentals (PE 11.9, strong dividend)\n4. **BA**: Earnings beat with $10.6B deal but significant uncertainty narrative\n5. **CRM**: Strong technical recovery, BofA software pick, small position\n6. **PG/JNJ**: Large concentrations with upcoming earnings (PG) and sector pressures (JNJ)\n\nResource allocation strategy:\n- Reduce TRV concentration from 9.2% to ~6.6%\n- Increase CRM based on technical recovery and analyst confidence\n- Increase BA moderately on earnings beat while managing uncertainty\n- Preserve cash for opportunities, ensure no stock exceeds 8% allocation\n- Total cash change: -$1,500 (TRV decrease) + $679 (CRM increase) + $892 (BA increase) = $71 within limits\n\nRisk management:\n- Maintain defensive positions (JNJ, PG, TRV) but with controlled sizing\n- Monitor UNH for fundamental business impact\n- Balance growth opportunities (CRM, BA)
