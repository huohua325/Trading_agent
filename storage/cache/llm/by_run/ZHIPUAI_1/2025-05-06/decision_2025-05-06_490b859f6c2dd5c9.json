Use comprehensive analysis combining technical, fundamental, and news data.\n\n- **Stocks WITHOUT fundamental_data**: These stocks were deemed suitable for technical analysis only. The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\"). Focus analysis on:\n  * Technical indicators and price patterns from market_data\n  * News sentiment and events from news_events  \n  * Position management and risk factors from position_state\n  * Historical decision consistency from history\n\n- **Filter Agent Reasoning**: The filter_reasoning field provides valuable context about the filtering decision.

Recent decrease to $3,500 shows risk management. High dividend yield 233.52% provides downside protection.\n\nUNH: Recently closed position following $200B market value loss news. Low PE ratio 14.92 suggests value but business challenges remain. Position closed at $0, keep closed.\n\nAXP: Technical signals adequate. Steady uptrend from $264.81 to $278.03. Buffett-related news is not material. Position at $3,765.87 is reasonable.\n\nAMGN: Drug performance updates positive but technical pullback from $290.92 to $280.06. PE ratio 23.33 is reasonable.

Quantum computing and retail news not material.\n\nAAPL: Sharp 6.8% decline from $213.32 to $198.89 over 2 days. Buffett investment commentary suggests potential strategic shift. PE ratio 37.67 is high. Recent decreases show risk management. Position at $1,952.37 is appropriately reduced.\n\nPG: Technical pattern sufficient. Stable range around $158-162. Position at $3,429.47 is moderate. Dividend news is routine.\n\nJNJ: Technical analysis sufficient. Stable pattern around $155. Position at $5,435.73 is largest but within limits (7.2%).
