Use comprehensive analysis combining technical, fundamental, and news data.\n\n- **Stocks WITHOUT fundamental_data**: These stocks were deemed suitable for technical analysis only. The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\"). Focus analysis on:\n  * Technical indicators and price patterns from market_data\n  * News sentiment and events from news_events  \n  * Position management and risk factors from position_state\n  * Historical decision consistency from history\n\n- **Filter Agent Reasoning**: The filter_reasoning field provides valuable context about the filtering decision.

of portfolio)\n- 20 stocks, average allocation: $4,852.47\n- Portfolio is nearly fully invested, severely limiting new buying opportunities\n\nCritical Issues Identified:\n1. **GS**: 8% price decline (617.77→567.67) with strong fundamentals (PE 15.8, dividend yield 1.9843%) and major M&A activity ($19B Panama Canal acquisition)\n2. **MSFT**: Largest position at 10.1% allocation, high PE 37.17, AI leadership position\n3. **UNH**: Recent positive legal development (Medicare lawsuit dismissal recommendation) but budget cut concerns\n4. **BA**: Severe 8.4% decline due to tariffs and defense contract loss, concerning fundamentals\n5. **AMZN**: 7.7% allocation with high volatility and P/E valuation concerns\n\nCash Allocation Strategy:\n- Only $1,907 available for all adjustments\n- Must prioritize risk management and position optimization\n- Focus on reducing high-risk positions and adding to undervalued opportunities\n\nDecision Logic:\n1. Reduce BA position due to fundamental deterioration and technical weakness\n2. Add to GS on dip with strong fundamentals and M&A catalyst\n3. Maintain MSFT position despite concentration due to AI leadership\n4. Hold UNH given positive legal development\n5. Hold AMZN but monitor valuation closely\n6. Maintain other stable positions with appropriate allocations\n\nRisk Management:\n- Portfolio concentration in MSFT (10.1%) and AMZN (7.7%) requires monitoring\n- BA position reduction to mitigate
