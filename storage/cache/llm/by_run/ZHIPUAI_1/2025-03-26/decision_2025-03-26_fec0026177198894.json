Use comprehensive analysis combining technical, fundamental, and news data.\n\n- **Stocks WITHOUT fundamental_data**: These stocks were deemed suitable for technical analysis only. The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\"). Focus analysis on:\n  * Technical indicators and price patterns from market_data\n  * News sentiment and events from news_events  \n  * Position management and risk factors from position_state\n  * Historical decision consistency from history\n\n- **Filter Agent Reasoning**: The filter_reasoning field provides valuable context about the filtering decision.

$96,542.55, Available cash: $4,689.92, Position value: $91,852.63\n- 22 stocks in portfolio, average allocation should be ~$4,388 per stock\n- Portfolio is 95.1% invested, with limited cash for new positions\n- Most positions have been held for 17 days, indicating recent rebalancing\n\nKey Risk Assessment:\n1. UNH: DOJ investigation into billing practices and fiduciary duties - major regulatory risk\n2. BA: Seeking to withdraw guilty plea in 737 MAX crashes - significant legal/governance risk  \n3. AMGN: Large position (7.9% of portfolio) with pharma tariff concerns\n4. Several stocks near 52-week highs (UNH at $513.43 vs $630.73 high)\n\nTechnical Momentum Analysis:\n- Strongest momentum: JPM (+7.4%), BA (+12.8%), GS (+6.3%), AXP (+5.7%)\n- Weakest: PG (-4.1%), AMGN (-3.3%), TRV (-2.2%)\n- Most stocks showing recovery patterns from recent lows\n\nFundamental Analysis (for stocks with data):\n- UNH: Reasonable PE 14.92, but legal risks outweigh fundamentals\n- AMGN: Higher PE 23.33, solid dividend, but sector concerns\n- BA: PE 0.0 indicates earnings issues, legal risk compounds problems\n\nPosition Management:\n- Several positions above average allocation (AMGN $7,238, JNJ $6,463, PG $6,307)\n- Some below average (SHW $2,001, TRV $3,021, CRM $2,598)\n- Portfolio reasonably diversified across sectors\n\nCash Constraints:\n- Only $4,689.92 available for any increases\n- Must prioritize highest conviction opportunities\n- No room for large position increases\n\nDecision Strategy:\n1. Reduce exposure to high-risk stocks (UNH, BA)\n2. Maintain strong momentum stocks (JPM, GS, AXP)\n3. Hold stable positions in defensive stocks\n4. Small tactical increases where fundamentals support\n</THINK>\n\n<DECISION>\n{\n  \"decisions\": {\n    \"GS\": {\n      \"action\": \"hold\",\n      \"reasons\": [\n        \"Strong 6.3% uptrend in
