movements within expected ranges\n- However, several stocks show meaningful trends that warrant fundamental context: AMGN's strong uptrend, BA's recovery pattern, and CRM's recent decline\n\n**News Impact Assessment:**\n- Multiple significant corporate events requiring fundamental validation:\n  - AMGN: Major Phase 3 clinical trial results (40% death risk reduction in lung cancer)\n  - UNH: Earnings miss and Medicare Advantage cost challenges\n  - BA: Regulatory hearings and production rate increases\n  - GS: Corporate strategic initiatives (new fund launches, conviction list changes)\n  - MSFT/AMZN: Significant AI and robotics investments\n  - JNJ: Positive clinical trial data\n  - HON: Strategic aerospace focus at Paris Air Show\n\n**Position Risk Analysis:**\n- Large positions (>7% of portfolio) requiring fundamental justification:\n  - JNJ: 8.7% ($8,006.78) - largest position with recent increases\n  - TRV: 7.7% ($7,077.72) - at 52-week high\n  - AMZN: 7.5% ($6,847.13) -

momentum\n\n**Historical Context Review:**\n- Recent decision patterns show fundamental dependency for several stocks\n- AMGN and JNJ had recent increase actions following positive news\n- UNH had decrease actions following earnings concerns\n- CRM had decrease actions during technical decline\n\n**Portfolio Concentration Risk:**\n- Top 3 positions (JNJ, TRV, MSFT) represent 24.9% of total
