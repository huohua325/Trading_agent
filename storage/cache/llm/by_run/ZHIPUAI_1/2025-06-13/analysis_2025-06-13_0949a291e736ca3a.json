"\n<ANALYSIS>\n**Market Signals Analysis**\n- **Technical Anomalies**: Most stocks show normal volatility patterns within expected ranges. IBM shows strong uptrend momentum with 5.8% gain over 7 days, potentially indicating breakout patterns. BA exhibits higher volatility with 3.8% decline but within normal technical ranges. UNH shows recovery pattern from recent lows with 6.1% gain.\n\n- **Momentum Sustainability**: MSFT, AMZN, and IBM demonstrate sustainable upward momentum with consistent daily gains. CAT shows steady uptrend with dividend announcement support. MCD and SHW display corrective patterns requiring monitoring.\n\n**News Impact Assessment**\n- **Corporate Events**: CAT's 7% dividend increase to $1.51/share represents material corporate action requiring fundamental validation. HON's $2.16B Sundyne acquisition constitutes significant M&A activity. IBM's quantum computing roadmap announcement represents major technological breakthrough.\n- **Business Developments**: MSFT's ROG Xbox handheld gaming entry and OpenAI partnerships represent strategic expansion. AMZN's nuclear power data center deal indicates major infrastructure investment.\n- **Industry Challenges**: MCD faces GLP-1 drug concerns and multiple analyst downgrades requiring fundamental risk assessment. UNH's fraud allegations and 26.6% May decline represent serious corporate governance issues.\n\n**Position Risk Management**\n- **Large Positions**: MSFT (10.4%), AMZN (8.3%), JNJ (8.3%), HON (7.1%), and AXP (7.0%) represent significant portfolio allocations requiring fundamental justification.\n- **Extended Holdings**: All positions held 74 days except UNH (60 days) and BA (67 days), indicating mature positions ripe for fundamental review.\n- **Concentration Risk**: Top 5 positions (MSFT, AMZN, JNJ, HON, AXP) represent 41.1% of portfolio, warranting fundamental validation.\n\n**Historical Context Analysis**\n- **Decision Patterns**: Recent increases in MSFT, CAT, UNH, IBM, AMZN indicate positive fundamental signals. Decreases in MCD, TRV, CRM suggest fundamental concerns.\n- **Strategy Consistency**: High confidence decisions (0.85) in MSFT and AMZN align with fundamental-dependent approach for large positions.\n</ANALYSIS>\n\n<FILTER_RESULT>\n{\n  \"stocks_need_fundamental\": [\"MSFT\", \"CAT\", \"MCD\", \"UNH\", \"IBM\", \"HON\", \"AMZN\"],\n  \"reasoning\": {\n    \"MSFT\": \"Large position (10.4% of portfolio) with significant AI partnerships and gaming expansion developments requiring fundamental validation of growth trajectory\",\n    \"CAT\": \"Corporate action (7% dividend increase to $1.51/share) represents material financial policy change requiring fundamental assessment of payout sustainability\",\n    \"MCD\": \"Multiple analyst downgrades and GLP-1 drug industry challenges require fundamental validation of business model resilience and earnings outlook\",\n    \"UNH\": \"Major fraud allegations and 26.6% May price decline represent significant corporate governance and valuation risks requiring fundamental investigation\",\n    \"IBM\": \"Quantum computing breakthrough announcement and 5.8% weekly surge require fundamental validation of technological roadmap and revenue potential\",\n    \"HON\": \"Large position (7.1% of portfolio) with $2.16B Sundyne acquisition requires fundamental assessment of M&A synergies and integration risks\",\n    \"AMZN\": \"Large position (8.3% of portfolio) with nuclear power data center infrastructure investment requires fundamental validation of capital allocation strategy\",\n    \"GS\": \"Technical pattern sufficient: stable 4.3% weekly gain, routine business expansion news, position size within normal allocation limits\",\n    \"HD\": \"Routine technical signals: slight downtrend within normal range, no material news catalysts, standard position management adequate\",\n    \"V\": \"Business developments but normal technical pattern: stable price action, position size manageable, conference presentations routine\",\n    \"SHW\": \"Small position (1.6%): routine analyst commentary, normal technical pattern, no fundamental concerns identified\",\n    \"AXP\": \"Large position but normal patterns: stable technical action, routine spending trend news, no major fundamental triggers\",\n    \"AMGN\": \"Positive momentum but no major news: steady uptrend, routine momentum commentary, position size manageable without fundamental review\",\n    \"TRV\": \"Technical volatility but no major news: normal price fluctuation range, position size acceptable, routine management adequate\",\n    \"CRM\": \"Small position (1.1%): AI partnerships noted but position size doesn't warrant fundamental analysis cost\",\n    \"JPM\": \"Large position but normal patterns: stable technical range, routine banking sector news, no fundamental red flags\",\n    \"BA\": \"Small position (1.0%): China deliveries resume noted but position size doesn't require fundamental validation\",\n    \"AAPL\": \"Small position (2.1%): WWDC updates routine, normal technical pattern, no major fundamental concerns\",\n    \"PG\": \"Routine corporate governance: board appointment normal, stable technical pattern, position size appropriate\",\n    \"JNJ\": \"Large position but routine news: board appointment standard, normal technical stability, no fundamental triggers\"\n  }\n}\n</FILTER_RESULT>"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 15924, "completion_tokens": 4003, "total_tokens": 19927}}, "parsed_response_length": 2879, "raw_response_length": 5400}}
