fundamental analysis requirements based on technical anomalies, news-driven events, position risk, valuation inflection points, strategy consistency, and portfolio concentration.\n\n**Market Signals Analysis:**\n- Multiple stocks show high volatility patterns (AAPL 17.8%, BA 17.7%, UNH 14.2%, HON 13%, AXP 13.3%, TRV 12.5%)\n- These volatility levels exceed normal technical analysis reliability thresholds\n- Several stocks are approaching or at technical inflection points\n\n**News Impact Assessment:**\n- Earnings announcements: GS, UNH, TRV, JNJ specifically mentioned in upcoming earnings reports\n- Regulatory developments: AAPL, MSFT have significant tariff exemption news\n- Company-specific events: CRM has fundamental analysis questions, AMZN has business development news\n- JPM already reported Q1 earnings with specific results\n\n**Position Risk Analysis:**\n- Large positions requiring fundamental validation: PG (8.2%), MCD (7.5%), JNJ (7.4%), MSFT (7.2%)\n- Portfolio concentration risk: Top 5 positions represent 35% of total portfolio value\n- Extended holding periods: All positions held for exactly 30 days, indicating systematic review needed\n\n**Historical Context:**\n- Recent high-confidence decreases in several volatile stocks (CAT, BA, GS, AMZN)\n- Strategy consistency shows fundamental analysis has been used previously for earnings-related decisions\n- Risk management patterns indicate fundamental dependency for large positions during volatile periods\n</ANALYSIS>\n\n<FILTER_RESULT>\n{\n  \"stocks_need_fundamental\": [\"GS\", \"MSFT\",
