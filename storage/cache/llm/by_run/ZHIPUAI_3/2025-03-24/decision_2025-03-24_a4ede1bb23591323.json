Use comprehensive analysis combining technical, fundamental, and news data.\n\n- **Stocks WITHOUT fundamental_data**: These stocks were deemed suitable for technical analysis only. The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\"). Focus analysis on:\n  * Technical indicators and price patterns from market_data\n  * News sentiment and events from news_events  \n  * Position management and risk factors from position_state\n  * Historical decision consistency from history\n\n- **Filter Agent Reasoning**: The filter_reasoning field provides valuable context about the filtering decision.

cash: $3,721.60, 21 stocks\n- Average allocation per stock: ~$4,601\n- Portfolio well-diversified across sectors with largest position UNH at 8.8%\n- Cash constraint requires selective allocation\n\nKey Findings:\n1. BA (Boeing) - Strong 11.8% price surge from Air Force fighter jet contract win, material corporate event requiring fundamental validation. Current position $3,190.99 below average allocation, positive momentum supports increase.\n\n2. SHW (Sherwin-Williams) - Insider selling of $1.3m suggests concerns, slight downtrend in close_7d, elevated PE ratio of 33.93. Current position $5,007.47 above average, warrants reduction.\n\n3. Other positions showing stable patterns with no material catalysts requiring changes. Most positions near average allocation with limited available cash.\n\nRisk Assessment:\n- Concentration risk manageable with UNH largest at 8.8%\n- Sector diversification adequate across financials, tech, healthcare, consumer\n- Technical stability across most holdings\n\nDecision Logic:\n- Prioritize BA due to positive corporate catalyst and momentum\n- Reduce SHW due to insider selling and technical weakness\n- Maintain other positions given stability and cash constraints\n- Respect total assets constraint and portfolio balance\n\nCash Allocation:\n- BA increase: $1,009.01 to
