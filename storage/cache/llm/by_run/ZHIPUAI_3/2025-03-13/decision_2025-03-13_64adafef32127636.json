Use comprehensive analysis combining technical, fundamental, and news data.\n\n- **Stocks WITHOUT fundamental_data**: These stocks were deemed suitable for technical analysis only. The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\"). Focus analysis on:\n  * Technical indicators and price patterns from market_data\n  * News sentiment and events from news_events  \n  * Position management and risk factors from position_state\n  * Historical decision consistency from history\n\n- **Filter Agent Reasoning**: The filter_reasoning field provides valuable context about the filtering decision.

$22,542.16, Position value: $72,082.03\n- 23 stocks total, average allocation per stock: $4,114\n- Major concentration risks: V (15.1%), MSFT (12.6%), HD (9.4%), UNH (8.3%)\n\n**Key Risk Factors:**\n1. **V**: Largest position at 15.1% with new AI fraud prevention initiative requiring strategic assessment\n2. **MSFT**: Large position at 12.6% approaching 52-week highs with dividend announcement\n3. **UNH**: Legal investigation by Rosen Law Firm creates significant uncertainty\n4. **GS**: Multiple corporate events (CEO IPO expectations, managing director departure)\n5. **AXP**: Elevated 11% volatility with substantial price decline\n6. **BA**: Operational concerns with safety meetings and delivery data\n\n**Technical Analysis Summary:**\n- Most stocks show normal volatility patterns (4-7%)\n- GS shows elevated 9% volatility requiring fundamental validation\n- AXP shows 11% volatility exceeding technical reliability\n- BA shows 10% volatility with operational developments\n\n**Cash Allocation Strategy:**\n- Available cash: $22,542.16\n- Focus on reducing concentration in oversized positions\n- Maintain strategic core holdings while managing risk\n- Consider opportunistic additions to underweighted positions\n\n**Decision Logic:**\n1. Reduce V and MSFT positions to manage concentration risk\n2. Hold UNH given recent significant reduction and legal uncertainty\n3. Maintain GS position despite volatility for strategic reasons\n4. Hold AXP to monitor volatility resolution\n5. Consider small position in TRV given new product launch\n6. Maintain most positions with technical-only analysis\n\n**Portfolio Rebalancing Targets:**\n- Reduce V from $10,849.85 to $9,500 (freeing $1,349.85)\n- Reduce MSFT from $9,099.93 to $8,000 (freeing $1,099.93)\n- Potential new TRV position: $3,000\n- Total cash needed: $3,000 - $2,449.78 = $550.22 (well within available cash)\n</THINK>\n\n<DECISION>\n{\n  \"decisions\": {\n    \"GS\": {\n
