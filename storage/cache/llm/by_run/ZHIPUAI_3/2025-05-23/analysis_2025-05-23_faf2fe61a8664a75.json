"\n<ANALYSIS>\nI'll analyze each stock for fundamental analysis requirements using the professional criteria framework:\n\n**Market Signals Analysis:**\n- Most stocks show normal volatility patterns within expected ranges\n- UNH shows extreme volatility (274.35 to 321.58, 17% swing) requiring validation\n- AAPL shows significant decline from 212.33 to 201.36 (5.2% drop) in downtrend\n- GS experienced notable drop from 619.03 to 593.46 (4.1%) before recovery\n\n**News Impact Assessment:**\n- GS: Major corporate restructuring (Asia IB business consolidation) - fundamental catalyst\n- MSFT: AI partnerships and product announcements - incremental developments\n- HD: Pricing strategy and housing market exposure - strategic implications\n- UNH: Major regulatory changes (Medicare Advantage audit expansion) and legal issues - critical\n- JNJ: FDA advisory panel decision on Darzalex Faspro - material clinical development\n- MCD: Dividend announcement and legal issues - mixed fundamental relevance\n- BA: Political controversy and airline restructuring - corporate governance concerns\n\n**Position Risk Evaluation:**\n- Portfolio concentration risk: Low cash (9.1%) with high equity exposure\n- Large positions: GS (9.1%), MSFT (8.2%), CAT (8.7%), TRV (5.9%) - warrant review\n- Extended holdings: Most positions held 55-59 days - approaching review threshold\n\n**Historical Context:**\n- Recent active trading on UNH (closed and reopened position) indicates sensitivity\n- GS had recent increases suggesting bullish sentiment\n- Multiple stocks with recent position adjustments indicate active management\n\n**Fundamental Analysis Triggers:**\n1. UNH: Regulatory impact on Medicare Advantage + extreme volatility + legal issues\n2. GS: Corporate restructuring + significant position size\n3. JNJ: FDA panel decision on key drug pipeline\n4. AAPL: Downtrend pattern + strategic concerns about future business model\n</ANALYSIS>\n\n<FILTER_RESULT>\n{\n  \"stocks_need_fundamental\": [\"UNH\", \"GS\", \"JNJ\", \"AAPL\"],\n  \"reasoning\": {\n    \"UNH\": \"Extreme 17% price volatility (274.35-321.58) combined with critical regulatory changes - expanded Medicare Advantage audits and ongoing legal issues create fundamental uncertainty requiring deep analysis\",\n    \"GS\": \"Major corporate restructuring (merging three Asia IB businesses) represents significant strategic change; position size (9.1% of portfolio) and recent volatility (619.03-593.46) warrant fundamental risk assessment\",\n    \"JNJ\": \"FDA advisory panel approval for Darzalex Faspro in new indication (high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma) represents material pipeline development requiring fundamental valuation impact analysis\",\n    \"AAPL\": \"Sustained downtrend (212.33-201.36, 5.2% decline) combined with strategic concerns about iPhone longevity; approaching valuation inflection point where fundamental metrics become critical\",\n    \"MSFT\": \"Technical pattern sufficient: stable range 452.94-458.87, AI news represents incremental developments rather than fundamental shifts\",\n    \"HD\": \"Routine signals: normal volatility, housing market news is cyclical rather than transformational, position management adequate\",\n    \"V\": \"Technical analysis adequate: stable pattern 356.46-367.9, analyst coverage but no material corporate events\",\n    \"SHW\": \"Small position (1.7% portfolio) with minimal news, technical pattern stable, no fundamental triggers\",\n    \"CAT\": \"Normal cyclical patterns, equipment financing news is industry-standard, position size within acceptable range\",\n    \"MCD\": \"Dividend announcement is routine operational matter, legal issues appear non-material to core business\",\n    \"AXP\": \"Technical pattern within normal parameters, news coverage is analytical rather than event-driven\",\n    \"AMGN\": \"Conference presentation and tariff exposure are known factors, no material new developments\",\n    \"TRV\": \"Dividend increase is standard corporate action, technical pattern stable\",\n    \"CRM\": \"AI partnerships and analyst coverage are expected for sector leader, no fundamental surprises\",\n    \"JPM\": \"Banking sector analysis is well-covered, regulatory environment known, position size manageable\",\n    \"IBM\": \"Partnership announcements are operational, technical pattern stable, no major strategic shifts\",\n    \"HON\": \"Refrigerant partnership and guidance raise are normal business developments\",\n    \"BA\": \"Political controversy creates noise but fundamental business trajectory unchanged\",\n    \"AMZN\": \"Nike partnership and pricing news are retail-level operational matters\",\n    \"PG\": \"Consumer products company with stable dividend history, technical pattern adequate\",\n    \"JNJ\": \"FDA panel approval already captured in reasoning above\"\n  }\n}\n</FILTER_RESULT>"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 15624, "completion_tokens": 1767, "total_tokens": 17391}}, "parsed_response_length": 2473, "raw_response_length": 4898}}
