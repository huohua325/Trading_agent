Use comprehensive analysis combining technical, fundamental, and news data.\n\n- **Stocks WITHOUT fundamental_data**: These stocks were deemed suitable for technical analysis only. The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\"). Focus analysis on:\n  * Technical indicators and price patterns from market_data\n  * News sentiment and events from news_events  \n  * Position management and risk factors from position_state\n  * Historical decision consistency from history\n\n- **Filter Agent Reasoning**: The filter_reasoning field provides valuable context about the filtering decision.

systematically:\n\n**Portfolio Overview:**\n- Total assets: $95,865.44\n- Available cash: $12,530.20  \n- Position value: $83,335.24\n- Number of stocks: 23\n- Average allocation per stock: $95,865.44 / 23 = ~$4,168\n\n**Key Risk & Opportunity Analysis:**\n\n1. **Position Concentration Issues:**\n   - MSFT ($8,185), AMGN ($9,218), JNJ ($9,201) significantly exceed average allocation\n   - These represent ~32% of total position value in just 3 stocks\n   - Need to rebalance for better risk management\n\n2. **Technical Patterns:**\n   - AMGN: -8.4% decline with clinical trial issues - high risk\n   - GS: Strong momentum (+3.5% in 7 days) with business model expansion\n   - V: Volatile (-7.5% decline) but crypto integration catalyst\n   - JPM: Strong uptrend (+3.7% in 7 days) with Fed policy tailwinds\n\n3. **Fundamental Assessment (for stocks with data):**\n   - MSFT: High PE (37.17) but strong market position\n   - AMGN: Good PE (23.33) but pipeline risks\n   - JNJ: Attractive PE (18.75) with strong dividend (294.3%)\n   - IBM: High PE (43.0) but AI rally momentum\n\n4. **News Catalysts:**\n   - GS: Private equity credit expansion - growth opportunity\n   - V: Crypto integration with regulatory risks\n   - CRM: RPO growth inflection potential\n   - JNJ: Multiple drug approvals\n\n5. **Cash Allocation Strategy:**\n   - Have $12,530 available for deployment\n   - Need to rebalance overweight positions\n   - Target more even distribution across 23 stocks\n\n**Decision Logic:**\n- Reduce oversized positions (MSFT, AMGN, JNJ) for risk management\n- Increase positions with strong catalysts and reasonable valuations\n- Maintain technical-only stocks with stable patterns\n- Ensure total position value stays within $95,865 limit\n- Focus on balanced allocation ~$4,000 per stock average\n\n**Portfolio Rebalancing Plan:**\n1. Reduce MSFT by $2,000 (from $8,185 to $6,185)\n2. Reduce AMGN by $1,500 (from $9,218 to $7,718)  \n3. Reduce JNJ by $1,200 (from $9,201 to $8,001)\n4. Increase GS by $1,000 (from $7,336 to $8,336)\n5. Increase V by $800 (from $1,561 to $2,361)\n6. Increase CRM by $500 (from $2,551 to $3,051)\n7. Increase HD by $400 (from $817 to $1,217)\n8. Increase JPM by $1,000 (from $5,604 to $6,604)\n\nNet cash change: -$4,700 + $3,700 = -$1,000 (well within available cash)\nThis improves portfolio balance while allocating to high-potential opportunities.\n</THINK>\n\n<DECISION>\n{\n  \"decisions\": {\n    \"GS\": {\n      \"action\": \"increase\",\n      \"target_cash_amount\": 8336.38,\n      \"reasons\": [\n        \"Strong 7-day
