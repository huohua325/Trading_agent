Use comprehensive analysis combining technical, fundamental, and news data.\n\n- **Stocks WITHOUT fundamental_data**: These stocks were deemed suitable for technical analysis only. The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\"). Focus analysis on:\n  * Technical indicators and price patterns from market_data\n  * News sentiment and events from news_events  \n  * Position management and risk factors from position_state\n  * Historical decision consistency from history\n\n- **Filter Agent Reasoning**: The filter_reasoning field provides valuable context about the filtering decision.

CRM: High valuation (P/E 35.46) after major acquisitions\n4. IBM: Lost major deal to competitor, high P/E 43.0\n5. JNJ: $442M antitrust ruling creates legal risk\n\nTechnical patterns show most stocks in stable ranges with modest momentum. News sentiment mixed with some strategic acquisitions (HON, AMZN) providing positive catalysts.\n\nPosition management strategy:\n- Reduce exposure to stocks with negative fundamental trends\n- Maintain positions in stable technical patterns with reasonable valuations\n- Consider rebalancing large positions to manage concentration risk\n- Preserve cash for better opportunities given mixed market signals\n\nCash constraint: Total target positions must not exceed $96,162.68, with purchases limited by $10,419.82 available cash.\n</THINK>\n\n<DECISION>\n{\n  \"decisions\": {\n    \"GS\":
