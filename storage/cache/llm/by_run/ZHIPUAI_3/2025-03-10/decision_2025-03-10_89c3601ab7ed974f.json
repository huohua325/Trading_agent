Use comprehensive analysis combining technical, fundamental, and news data.\n\n- **Stocks WITHOUT fundamental_data**: These stocks were deemed suitable for technical analysis only. The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\"). Focus analysis on:\n  * Technical indicators and price patterns from market_data\n  * News sentiment and events from news_events  \n  * Position management and risk factors from position_state\n  * Historical decision consistency from history\n\n- **Filter Agent Reasoning**: The filter_reasoning field provides valuable context about the filtering decision.
