Use comprehensive analysis combining technical, fundamental, and news data.\n\n- **Stocks WITHOUT fundamental_data**: These stocks were deemed suitable for technical analysis only. The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\"). Focus analysis on:\n  * Technical indicators and price patterns from market_data\n  * News sentiment and events from news_events  \n  * Position management and risk factors from position_state\n  * Historical decision consistency from history\n\n- **Filter Agent Reasoning**: The filter_reasoning field provides valuable context about the filtering decision.

Position value: $82,166.36\n- Number of stocks: 20\n- Average allocation: ~$4,693 per stock\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- Concentration risk: AMZN (8.9%), JPM (8.4%), V (8.5%) exceed normal allocation\n- Cash constraint: Limited $11,693.19 for new investments\n- Position diversity: Well spread across sectors\n\n**Stocks requiring fundamental analysis (7):**\n- MSFT: OpenAI $40B funding requires strategic validation\n- V: $100M Apple credit card deal impact assessment  \n- UNH: DOJ death penalty case legal risk evaluation\n- JPM: Large position (8.4%) concentration management\n- BA: Technical anomaly (-7.7%) with major corporate events\n- AMZN: Large position (8.9%) with -4.7% decline and AI competition\n- JNJ: -6.8% volatility with legal settlement rejection\n\n**Technical analysis stocks (13):**\n- GS, HD, SHW, CAT, MCD, AXP, AMGN, TRV, CRM, IBM, HON, AAPL, PG\n\n**Key Decisions:**\n1.
