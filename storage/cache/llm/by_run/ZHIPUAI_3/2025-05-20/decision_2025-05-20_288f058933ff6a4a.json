The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\").

V, CAT, JPM, AXP) and tech (MSFT)\n\nKey Technical Patterns:\n- Strong uptrends: GS ($567→$612), IBM ($249→$268), HON ($213→$225)\n- Consolidation: HD ($363→$379), CRM ($275→$288), AMZN ($193→$206)\n- Recovery: UNH ($381→$316 after gap down), BA ($195→$205)\n\nFundamental Validation Required (per filter reasoning):\n- GS: Large defensive position with institutional mentions\n- MSFT: AI strategy shifts and layoffs\n- V: Sector consolidation (Capital One-Discover merger)\n- CAT: UBS upgrade on trade outlook\n- UNH: Technical anomaly with 12% gap drop\n- BA: 737 MAX criminal charges and DOJ

Reduce over-concentrated positions slightly\n\nRisk Assessment:\n- Financial services concentration (5 positions, ~35% of portfolio)\n- Tech sector exposure (MSFT, CRM, IBM, AMZN, AAPL)\n- Legal risks (BA 737 MAX, AAPL patent litigation)\n- Valuation concerns (MSFT PE 37.17, V PE 32.12)\n\nDecision Logic:\n1. Hold large established positions (GS, MSFT, V)\n2. Increase positions with strong technicals + reasonable fundamentals (IBM, HON)\n3. Reduce slightly over-concentrated positions (CAT from 8.3% to ~7%)\n4. Maintain stable core holdings (HD, TRV, AXP, CRM, JPM)\n5. Hold defensive positions (PG, JNJ, AMGN)\n6.
