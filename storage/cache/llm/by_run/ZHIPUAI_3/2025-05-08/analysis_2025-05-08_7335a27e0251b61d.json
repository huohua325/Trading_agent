"<ANALYSIS>\n**Market Signals Analysis:**\n- **MSFT**: Significant price movement from 394.04 to 433.35 (10% gain) with a notable gap up on day 3 of the 7-day period. This represents unusual momentum that may require fundamental validation.\n- **AAPL**: Sharp decline from 213.32 to 196.25 (8% drop) with sustained downward momentum. This technical breakdown warrants fundamental investigation.\n- **UNH**: High volatility from 411.44 to 391.06 (5% decline) with significant daily swings, indicating potential fundamental concerns.\n- **AMGN**: Volatile pattern from 290.92 down to 275.84 with several reversal attempts, suggesting uncertainty.\n- Other stocks show relatively stable patterns within normal ranges.\n\n**News Impact Assessment:**\n- **MSFT**: Major OpenAI-related news including abandoned for-profit conversion, $3B Windsurf acquisition, and ongoing Musk lawsuit. These events directly impact Microsoft's AI strategy and require fundamental analysis.\n- **UNH**: Critical news including securities fraud class action lawsuit, cyberattack loan repayment disputes, and significant stock underperformance. These are material events requiring fundamental validation.\n- **AAPL**: Earnings call results, AI integration developments, and tariff risk discussions. The earnings beat combined with technical decline creates a disconnect needing fundamental analysis.\n- **CAT**: Q1 2025 earnings transcript mentioned, requiring fundamental review of business outlook.\n- **MCD**: Q1 earnings call with revenue miss and consumer pressure discussion.\n- **BA**: Aerospace tariff implications and trade war developments affecting fundamentals.\n\n**Position Risk Analysis:**\n- **MSFT**: Large position at $7,571.81 (10.7% of portfolio) with recent increases, representing significant concentration risk.\n- **V**: Position at $6,589.44 (9.3% of portfolio), another large concentration.\n- **UNH**: Position essentially closed (near-zero value) but recent history shows active management decisions.\n- Most other positions are well-diversified with reasonable allocations.\n\n**Historical Context:**\n- **MSFT**: Recent pattern of increases with high confidence (0.85), indicating strong conviction but requiring fundamental validation for continued exposure.\n- **UNH**: Recent position closure with high confidence (0.85), suggesting fundamental concerns were already identified.\n- **MCD**: Recent decrease action with target of $2,500, indicating risk management in progress.\n- **SHW**: Recent decreases suggesting risk reduction strategy.\n\n**Portfolio Concentration:**\nTotal portfolio value of $93,162.43 with MSFT and V representing ~20% combined exposure, making their fundamental health critical for portfolio stability.\n</ANALYSIS>\n\n<FILTER_RESULT>\n{\n  \"stocks_need_fundamental\": [\"MSFT\", \"UNH\", \"AAPL\", \"CAT\", \"MCD\", \"BA\"],\n  \"reasoning\": {\n    \"MSFT\": \"Large position (10.7% of portfolio) with significant 10% price movement and material OpenAI-related news events including $3B acquisition and strategic changes requiring fundamental validation\",\n    \"UNH\": \"Critical material events including securities fraud class action lawsuit and cyberattack disputes, combined with high technical volatility requiring fundamental risk assessment\",\n    \"AAPL\": \"Technical breakdown (8% decline) despite earnings beat, creating disconnect between fundamentals and price action requiring investigation\",\n    \"CAT\": \"Q1 2025 earnings transcript availability and recent position increases requiring fundamental business outlook validation\",\n    \"MCD\": \"Q1 earnings miss with revenue decline and consumer pressure concerns requiring fundamental business health assessment\",\n    \"BA\": \"Aerospace tariff implications and trade war developments directly impacting business fundamentals requiring analysis\",\n    \"GS\": \"Technical pattern sufficient: stable price action, routine analyst coverage, position size within normal allocation limits\",\n    \"HD\": \"Routine technical signals: normal volatility range, foundation investment news is non-material, standard position management adequate\",\n    \"V\": \"Technical pattern sufficient: stable momentum trend, no material news catalysts, position size approaching but within acceptable concentration limits\",\n    \"SHW\": \"Technical analysis adequate: customer satisfaction awards are positive but non-material, recent position reductions indicate risk management in progress\",\n    \"AMGN\": \"Routine technical analysis: volatility within normal range for biotech sector, no material news events requiring fundamental review\",\n    \"TRV\": \"Technical pattern sufficient: stable price movement, routine analyst coverage, position management appears adequate\",\n    \"CRM\": \"Technical signals adequate: analyst downgrade noted but not material enough for fundamental analysis, position size reasonable\",\n    \"JPM\": \"Technical analysis sufficient: stable banking sector performance, AI adoption news is positive but not fundamentally material at this level\",\n    \"IBM\": \"Technical pattern adequate: AI strategy news is incremental, recent position management indicates risk assessment already incorporated\",\n    \"HON\": \"Technical signals sufficient: stable industrial performance, conference participation is routine, position management appears appropriate\",\n    \"AXP\": \"Technical analysis adequate: normal credit card sector volatility, routine competitive analysis news, position size within limits\",\n    \"AMZN\": \"Technical pattern sufficient: stable e-commerce performance, news events are largely non-material for near-term trading decisions\",\n    \"PG\": \"Routine technical analysis: consumer staple stability, dividend news is positive but expected, position management adequate\",\n    \"JNJ\": \"Technical signals sufficient: healthcare sector stability, MedTech tariff concerns noted but not materially impacting current position\"\n  }\n}\n</FILTER_RESULT>"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 15965, "completion_tokens": 1139, "total_tokens": 17104}}, "parsed_response_length": 3016, "raw_response_length": 6046}}
