Use comprehensive analysis combining technical, fundamental, and news data.\n\n- **Stocks WITHOUT fundamental_data**: These stocks were deemed suitable for technical analysis only. The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\"). Focus analysis on:\n  * Technical indicators and price patterns from market_data\n  * News sentiment and events from news_events  \n  * Position management and risk factors from position_state\n  * Historical decision consistency from history\n\n- **Filter Agent Reasoning**: The filter_reasoning field provides valuable context about the filtering decision.

$22,577.94, Position value: $70,584.48\n- 22 stocks requiring decisions, average allocation ~$4,235 per stock\n- Cash constraint: Sum of positive cash changes ≤ $22,577.94\n- Total assets constraint: Sum of target amounts ≤ $93,162.43\n\nStock Analysis by Category:\n\n**WITH fundamental_data (comprehensive analysis needed):**\n1. **MSFT**: Large position (10.7% portfolio), strong 7-day momentum (+10%), OpenAI $3B acquisition news, but high P/E 37.17. Recent increases suggest conviction, but position size at concentration limit. HOLD to maintain risk balance.\n\n2. **CAT**: Solid uptrend (+4%), reasonable P/E 23.43, strong dividend 128.17%, Q1 earnings available. Recent position increases show confidence. HOLD at current level.\n\n3. **MCD**: Flat performance, Q1 revenue miss (-3.5%), consumer pressure concerns. Recent position reductions already implemented risk management. HOLD to monitor.\n\n4. **UNH**: Major legal risks (securities fraud lawsuit, cyberattack disputes), declining price trend. Position essentially closed. HOLD at zero.\n\n5. **BA**: Tariff impacts on aerospace, no dividend (yield 0.0%), P/E indicates losses. Trade war developments directly affect fundamentals. DECREASE to $2,000 from $3,032.98.\n\n6. **AAPL**: 8% technical breakdown despite earnings beat, high P/E 37.67. Disconnect between fundamentals and price action requires risk reduction. DECREASE to $2,500 from $3,428.46.\n\n**WITHOUT fundamental_data (technical analysis focus):**\n7. **GS**: Stable price action, routine analyst coverage. Filter agent deems technical sufficient. HOLD.\n8. **HD**: Normal volatility, foundation investment news non-material. HOLD.\n9. **V**: Stable momentum, position approaching concentration limits. HOLD.\n10. **SHW**: Customer satisfaction awards positive but incremental, recent risk management. HOLD.\n11. **AXP**: Normal credit card sector volatility, competitive analysis routine. HOLD.\n12. **AMGN**: Biotech volatility within normal range, no material events. HOLD.\n13. **TRV**: Stable insurance sector performance. HOLD.\n14. **CRM**: Analyst downgrade noted but not fundamentally material. HOLD.\n15. **JPM**: Stable banking, AI adoption positive but incremental. HOLD.\n16. **IBM**: AI strategy news incremental, position management adequate. HOLD.\n17. **HON**: Stable industrial performance, conference participation routine. HOLD.\n18. **AMZN**: Stable e-commerce, news largely non-material for trading. HOLD.\n19. **PG**: Consumer staple stability, dividend news expected. HOLD.\n20. **JNJ**: Healthcare stability, MedTech tariff concerns noted. HOLD.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- Concentration risk: MSFT at 10.7% approaching limit\n- Sector risk: Financials (GS, JPM, V, AXP) balanced\n- Technical risk: AAPL breakdown, BA tariff exposure\n- Legal risk: UNH litigation already addressed\n\n**Cash Impact:**\n- BA decrease: +$1,032.98 cash\n- AAPL decrease: +$928.46 cash  \n- Total cash freed: $1,961.44 (well within $22,577.94 available)\n- All target amounts sum to well below $93,162.43 total assets\n\n**Portfolio Strategy:**\nMaintain current diversification while reducing exposure to highest-risk positions (BA, AAPL). Preserve cash for better opportunities while respecting position limits and maintaining strategy consistency.\n</THINK>\n\n<DECISION>\n{\n  \"decisions\": {\n    \"GS\": {\n      \"action\":
