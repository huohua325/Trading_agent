ranges\n- AMGN shows notable volatility (-5.1% over 7 days) with a sharp drop from $295.56 to $272.44 before recovering\n- GS and JPM show strong uptrends (6.7% and 5.1% respectively) potentially related to banking sector news\n- No extreme technical anomalies detected that would automatically trigger fundamental requirements\n\n**News Impact Assessment:**\n- **GS/JPM**: Major regulatory rollback news for banks represents significant fundamental development affecting business models\n- **BA**: NTSB investigation findings on systemic failures and safety issues constitute material fundamental concerns\n- **AMGN**: Weight-loss drug adverse events and market cap drop indicate fundamental business risks\n- **CRM**: Major AI product launches (Agentforce 3) and new pricing strategies represent fundamental business model shifts\n- **V**: Stablecoin industry developments and lawsuit outcomes affect core business fundamentals\n- **MCD**: Consumer boycott call represents potential revenue impact requiring fundamental assessment\n- **IBM**: Quantum computing system launch represents significant technological investment\n- **AAPL**: AI chip development and potential Perplexity acquisition are strategic fundamental developments\n- **JNJ**: Talc lawsuit verdict and large position size (10.7% of portfolio) require fundamental risk validation\n\n**Position Risk Analysis:**\n- JNJ (10.7%), GS (10.0%), and JPM (9.3%) represent largest positions requiring fundamental justification\n- Most positions held for 70-83 days, indicating extended holding periods that warrant periodic fundamental review\n- Portfolio is well-diversified with no single stock representing excessive concentration\n\n**Historical Context:**\n- Recent trading activity shows active position management with multiple increases/decreases\n- No clear historical pattern of fundamental dependency for most stocks\n- Recent decreases in AMGN and increases in JNJ suggest active risk management\n\n**Professional Criteria Application:**\n- News-driven events (regulatory changes, safety investigations, product launches) trigger fundamental requirements\n- Large positions (>9% of portfolio) require fundamental risk validation\n- Extended holding periods (70+ days) with significant news events necessitate fundamental review\n- Technical analysis sufficient for routine trading decisions without material news catalysts\n</ANALYSIS>\n\n<FILTER_RESULT>\n{\n  \"stocks_need_fundamental\": [\"GS\", \"JPM\", \"BA\", \"AMGN\", \"CRM\", \"V\", \"MCD\", \"IBM\", \"AAPL\", \"JNJ\"],\n
