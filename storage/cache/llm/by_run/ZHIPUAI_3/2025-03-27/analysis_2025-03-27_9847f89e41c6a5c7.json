"\n<ANALYSIS>\n**Market Signals Analysis:**\n- Technical volatility assessment across close_7d patterns shows GS, BA, and AMGN with notable price movements requiring fundamental validation\n- GS shows peak-and-drop pattern (585.94 to 573.92) indicating potential volatility requiring confirmation\n- BA exhibits significant volatility (161.57 to 182.59) with sharp movements suggesting technical anomalies\n- AMGN shows declining trend (318.65 to 305.71) with industry-wide concerns requiring fundamental context\n\n**News Impact Evaluation:**\n- UNH: DOJ investigation into billing practices represents material regulatory event requiring fundamental risk assessment\n- BA: Critical legal developments regarding 737 MAX guilty plea withdrawal represent corporate action with material impact\n- AMGN: Industry-wide tariff concerns and pharmaceutical sector pressures require fundamental validation\n- AAPL: Major AI infrastructure investment ($1B in Nvidia systems) represents strategic corporate action\n\n**Position Risk Management:**\n- Portfolio concentration analysis shows top positions: JPM (7.6%), V (7.6%), MSFT (7.4%) - all within reasonable allocation limits\n- No position exceeds 10% threshold, but larger positions (JPM, V, MSFT) approaching 8% warrant monitoring\n- Position holding periods consistent (14-18 days) with no extended holds requiring fundamental review\n\n**Historical Context:**\n- Recent UNH decrease action (March 26) with high confidence (0.9) suggests fundamental dependency\n- BA recent decrease action (March 26) with high confidence (0.85) indicates fundamental risk management\n- Other stocks show consistent technical-based decision patterns\n\n**Professional Criteria Application:**\n- UNH: Regulatory investigation meets News-Driven Events criterion\n- BA: Legal proceedings meet News-Driven Events criterion  \n- AMGN: Industry volatility meets Technical Anomalies criterion\n- AAPL: Strategic AI investment meets News-Driven Events criterion\n- Other stocks: Technical patterns adequate, position sizes manageable, no material news events\n</ANALYSIS>\n\n<FILTER_RESULT>\n{\n  \"stocks_need_fundamental\":
