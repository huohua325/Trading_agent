including 737 MAX fraud trial, legal proceedings, analyst conflicts\n- AMZN: AI shopping tool launch and strategic positioning updates\n- AAPL: China iPhone sales slump concerns and potential $1B Nvidia server investment\n- JNJ: Positive Phase 3 lung cancer drug trial results - material clinical development\n\n**Position Risk Analysis:**\n- Large positions (>7% portfolio): MSFT (8.2%), V (8.5%), JPM (8.4%) - MSFT news requires fundamental validation\n- Recent positions (<10 days): JPM (9 days), IBM (9 days), HON (6 days), BA (6 days) - BA's legal issues require fundamental review\n- Most positions held 15-19 days with normal risk profiles\n\n**Historical Context:**\n- Recent decreases in UNH, AMGN, BA suggest active risk management\n- BA shows recent volatility with multiple
