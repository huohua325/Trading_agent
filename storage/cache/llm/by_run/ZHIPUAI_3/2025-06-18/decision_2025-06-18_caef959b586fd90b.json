needed for stocks with fundamental concerns and regulatory headwinds\n\nKey Stock Analysis:\n\n**High Risk - Decrease Positions:**\n1. MSFT: OpenAI partnership uncertainty with financial concession requests creates business risk (filter reasoning confirms)\n2. SHW: Citi downgrade citing housing slump directly impacts fundamentals, declining technical pattern (-8.2% from highs)\n3. UNH: Proposed Medicaid cuts and Medicare Advantage commission reductions represent major regulatory risk\n4. BA: Air India crash investigation and ongoing aerospace safety concerns could impact order flow\n\n**Moderate Risk - Hold Positions:**\n- GS, CAT, AMGN, TRV: Stable business models with positive news catalysts\n- V, CRM, IBM, HON: Technical stability with industry tailwinds\n- AXP, JPM, PG, AAPL: Normal business operations with reasonable valuations\n\n**Small Positions - Maintain:**\n- HD, MCD: Small sizes (<2% portfolio) limit downside, no material catalysts\n\n**Capital Allocation Strategy:**\n- Decrease 4 high-risk positions to free ~$3,500 cash\n- Reallocate to 3 strongest positions: GS (Dow rally contributor), CAT (dividend growth), IBM (AI momentum)\n- Ensure total target amounts stay within $95,305.75 limit\n- Maintain portfolio diversification while reducing concentration risk\n\nCash Flow Validation:\n- Decreases generate ~$3,500 additional cash availability\n- Planned increases total ~$2,000, well within available cash constraints\n- Final portfolio maintains proper
