Analysis:**\n- Most stocks show normal volatility patterns within expected ranges\n- GS shows elevated volatility with 7-day decline from 565.14 to 546.29 (~3.4% drop)\n- AMZN shows notable decline from 196.21 to 190.26 (~3% drop) in AI sector\n- BA shows continued weakness from 178.11 to 170.55\n- Technical patterns are generally stable across the portfolio with no extreme anomalies requiring immediate fundamental validation\n\n**News Impact Assessment:**\n- **GS**: Critical macroeconomic news including recession probability increase to 35%, insider selling concerns, and market volatility from Trump's \"Liberation Day\" - these are fundamental economic factors\n- **UNH**: Legal investigation for breaches of fiduciary duties by directors/officers - this is a significant corporate governance issue requiring fundamental assessment\n- **CAT**: Strategic technology partnership with Luminar for LiDAR automation - represents fundamental business model evolution\n- **BA**: Fighter jet contract news and technical analysis calls - mixed signals on fundamental outlook\n- **MSFT/AMZN/AAPL**: AI sector news but largely industry-wide trends rather than company-specific fundamental events\n\n**Position Risk Analysis:**\n- Large positions (>6% portfolio): V (8.5%), AMZN (8.6%), JPM (8.3%), MSFT (6.8%), JNJ (6.8%)\n- Most large positions are in stable companies with normal technical patterns\n- UNH shows pattern of position reductions in history (multiple decreases) suggesting ongoing fundamental concerns\n- GS position size is moderate (5.2%) but economic sensitivity is high\n\n**Historical Context Review:**\n- UNH: Clear pattern of decreases (3/25, 3/26, 3/27, 3/31) indicating fundamental concerns\n- GS: Recent decrease on 3/31 with high confidence (0.8) suggesting risk management\n- BA: Complete position closure on 3/28 with high confidence (0.85)\n- Most other stocks show consistent \"hold\" patterns indicating technical sufficiency\n\n**Portfolio Concentration:**\n- Portfolio is well-diversified with no single position exceeding 9%\n- Concentration risk is manageable, but economic-sensitive positions like GS require fundamental validation\n</ANALYSIS>\n\n<FILTER_RESULT>\n{\n  \"stocks_need_fundamental\": [\"GS\", \"UNH\", \"CAT\", \"BA\"],\n  \"reasoning\": {\n    \"GS\": \"Critical macroeconomic news requiring fundamental
