Signals Analysis:**\n- GS shows significant volatility with close_7d pattern dropping from 585.94 to 543.12 (-7.3%), indicating technical anomaly requiring validation\n- MSFT, AMZN, and AAPL show moderate volatility but within normal ranges for tech stocks\n- CRM shows notable decline from 288.61 to 269.97 (-6.5%) but position size is small\n- Most stocks (HD, V, SHW, TRV, PG, JNJ) display stable technical patterns with normal volatility\n\n**News Impact Assessment:**\n- GS: Contains material corporate events - Q1 earnings preview, price target reduction, and Glass Lewis recommending votes against CEO pay\n- HON: Material business development - Quantinuum IPO plans within 2 years with ~$10B valuation target\n- UNH: Significant regulatory concern - Rosen Law Firm investigation of fiduciary duty breaches\n- Most other stocks have opinion pieces or general market commentary without material corporate actions\n\n**Position Risk Analysis:**\n- Largest positions: V (8.6%), JPM (8.5%), GS (7.1%), MSFT (7.0%) - all below 10% threshold\n- No extreme concentration risk requiring fundamental review based on size alone\n- Most positions held 16-20 days, consistent with normal trading timeframe\n\n**Historical Context Review:**\n- Recent decisions show mixed actions (increase/decrease) across portfolio\n- No clear pattern of fundamental dependency for most stocks\n- UNH shows recent decrease actions with high confidence (0.85-0.9), suggesting risk management focus\n\n**Portfolio Concentration:**\n- Well-diversified with 22 positions\n- No single position exceeds risk management thresholds\n- Sector distribution appears balanced\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOnly stocks with material corporate events, regulatory concerns, or significant business developments require
