The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\").

$94,890.91 total assets with $16,320.41 available cash across 22 positions (average ~$4,313 per stock). Key risk factors identified:\n\n1. UNH: Extreme 23% single-day collapse (404.81 to 311.38) due to Trump drug pricing executive order and class action lawsuits - major technical anomaly requiring fundamental validation\n2. CAT: 9% surge on tariff deal news combined with $2B offering announcement - requires financing impact assessment\n3. GS: 8% momentum with Q1 earnings catalyst - fundamental validation needed\n4. V: $130B share buyback program directly impacts shareholder value\n5. MSFT: Largest position at 11.7% of assets, approaching potential continuation point\n6. Multiple pharma stocks (AMGN, JNJ) exposed to drug pricing order impacts\n7. PG: Q1 earnings miss with lowered EPS outlook\n\nTechnical analysis sufficient for: HD, SHW, MCD, AXP, TRV, CRM, JPM, IBM, BA, AMZN, AAPL - these show normal price patterns without material events.\n\nCash allocation strategy: With $16,320.41 available and 22 stocks, need balanced deployment. Focus on high-impact opportunities while respecting total_assets constraint of $94,890.91.\n\nRisk-first approach: Prioritize reducing exposure to UNH (extreme technical anomaly), while selectively
