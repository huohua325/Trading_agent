(6.7% range) with recent price recovery from 524.81 to 551.34, but no extreme technical anomalies\n- MSFT exhibits stable volatility (3.8% range) with consolidation around 380-390 level\n- HD displays higher volatility (8.5% range) with significant swing from 376.8 to 347.25, indicating potential technical stress\n- V shows moderate volatility (5.1% range) with stable consolidation pattern\n- SHW demonstrates elevated volatility (6.2% range) with downward pressure from 363.62 to 342.25\n- Most other stocks show normal volatility patterns within expected ranges\n\n**News Impact Assessment:**\n- MSFT: Significant AI data center energy challenges news could impact long-term operational costs and growth strategy\n- SHW: Post-Q4 earnings analysis with 10.3% loss mentioned, requiring fundamental validation of earnings quality\n- AXP: Credit metrics showing 2.5% net write-off rate and 30-day delinquency trends indicate potential credit risk deterioration\n- HD: Tariff impact news could affect supply chain costs and margins\n- GS: Crude forecast changes and tariff risk news could affect trading and investment banking revenues\n\n**Position Risk Analysis:**\n- Portfolio concentration: MSFT ($8,082, 10%), UNH ($7,308, 9%), V ($6,096, 7.5%) represent larger positions\n- Recent position changes: Multiple recent decreases in March suggest portfolio rebalancing\n- Holding periods: Most

reduction\n- New positions in JPM, IBM, AMZN, AAPL indicate sector rotation\n- Confidence levels moderate to high (0.6-0.85) for most recent decisions\n\n**Fundamental Analysis Requirements:**\nBased on professional criteria, MSFT, SHW, and AXP require fundamental validation due to material news events and emerging risk factors that technical analysis alone cannot adequately assess.\n</ANALYSIS>\n\n<FILTER_RESULT>\n{\n  \"stocks_need_fundamental\": [\"MSFT\", \"SHW\", \"AXP\"],\n  \"reasoning\": {\n    \"MSFT\": \"AI data center energy challenges news could significantly
