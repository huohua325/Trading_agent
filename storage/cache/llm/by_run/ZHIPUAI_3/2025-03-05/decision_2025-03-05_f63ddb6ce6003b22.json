Use comprehensive analysis combining technical, fundamental, and news data.\n\n- **Stocks WITHOUT fundamental_data**: These stocks were deemed suitable for technical analysis only. The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\"). Focus analysis on:\n  * Technical indicators and price patterns from market_data\n  * News sentiment and events from news_events  \n  * Position management and risk factors from position_state\n  * Historical decision consistency from history\n\n- **Filter Agent Reasoning**: The filter_reasoning field provides valuable context about the filtering decision.

Concentration risk - multiple positions exceeding 15% threshold\n2. Market volatility - Dow down significantly, Magnificent Seven selling off\n3. Legal risk - UNH facing investigation\n4. Macroeconomic uncertainty - Trump tariffs impacting financial sector\n\nPosition Decisions:\n1. Reduce V from 18.0% to ~12% due to concentration risk despite strong fundamentals\n2. Reduce UNH from 17.3% to ~12% due to legal investigation risk\n3. Reduce HD from 16.6% to ~12% for portfolio rebalancing\n4. Hold GS at current level - reasonable valuation with macro uncertainty\n5. Hold MSFT at current level - tech sell-off but strong fundamentals\n6. Hold SHW at current level - stable technical pattern\n7. Hold AMGN - positive clinical news, small position\n8. Initiate small positions in undervalued dividend growers (AXP, CAT, JNJ, PG) with available cash\n\nCash Allocation Plan:\n- Available cash: $16,734.50\n- Total reductions: ~$8,000 (V, UNH, HD)\n- New positions: ~$8,000 across 4 stocks (~$2,000 each)\n</THINK>\n\n<DECISION>\n{\n  \"decisions\": {\n    \"GS\": {\n      \"action\": \"hold\",\n      \"reasons\": [\n        \"Reasonable valuation with
