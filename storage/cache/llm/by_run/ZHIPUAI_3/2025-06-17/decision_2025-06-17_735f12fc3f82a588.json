The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\").

allocation: $4,551.35\n- High utilization (93.5%) with minimal cash buffer\n- Concentration risks: MSFT (12.3%), AMGN (11.1%), JNJ (10.5%), AMZN (9.2%)\n\nKey Risk Factors:\n1. Large positions in \"Magnificent Seven\" with high valuations (MSFT PE 37.17, AMZN PE 33.33)\n2. Technical breakdown patterns in several holdings (SHW -6.1%, HD -3.75%, V -3.98%)\n3. Material corporate events requiring fundamental validation (dividend hikes, lawsuits, settlements)\n4. Limited cash for new opportunities\n\nStock-by-Stock Analysis:\n\n**With Fundamental Data (comprehensive review needed):**\n- MSFT: Large position with high valuation concerns, recent increase\n- SHW: Citi downgrade + technical breakdown (-6.1%), housing exposure risk\n- CAT: 7% dividend hike supports sustainability, reasonable PE 23.43\n- MCD: $10B lawsuit settlement, technical weakness (-3.6%)\n- UNH: Attractive PE 14.92, insider buying, no current position - opportunity\n- AMGN: Large position with pipeline catalysts, reasonable PE 23.33\n- IBM: High PE 43.0 with quantum momentum - overvalued\n- BA: Irregular fundamentals (PE 0.0), technical weakness (-4.3%)\n- AMZN: Large position with valuation concerns\n- JNJ: Reasonable valuation, strong pipeline\n\n**Without Fundamental Data (technical focus):**\n- GS: Positive momentum (+2.25%), Dow rallies\n- HD: Technical weakness (-3.75%), retail sector pressure\n- V: Normal volatility (-3.98%), payment business stable\n- AXP: Minor decline (-2.73%), routine management\n- TRV: Stable insurance (-3.13%), sponsorship news\n- CRM: Recovering from volatility (-3.87%)\n- JPM: Stable banking (+1.74%)\n- HON: Aerospace stable (-2.05%)\n- AAPL: Small position, minor weakness (-2.70%)\n- PG: Defensive staples (-1.91%)\n\nResource Allocation:\n- Need to reduce concentration in overvalued large positions\n- Preserve cash for UNH opportunity\n- Respect technical breakdown patterns\n- Maintain portfolio balance with 21 stocks\n\nDecision Logic:\n1. Reduce MSFT and AMZN due to valuation concerns and concentration\n2. Reduce SHW, MCD, BA, HD due to technical weakness/fundamental concerns\n3. Reduce IBM due to high PE ratio\n4. Initiate UNH position (attractive valuation, insider buying)\n5. Hold stable positions with reasonable valuations (CAT, AMGN, JNJ)\n6.
