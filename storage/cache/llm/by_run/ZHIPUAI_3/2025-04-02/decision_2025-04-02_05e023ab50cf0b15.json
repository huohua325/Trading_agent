Use comprehensive analysis combining technical, fundamental, and news data.\n\n- **Stocks WITHOUT fundamental_data**: These stocks were deemed suitable for technical analysis only. The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\"). Focus analysis on:\n  * Technical indicators and price patterns from market_data\n  * News sentiment and events from news_events  \n  * Position management and risk factors from position_state\n  * Historical decision consistency from history\n\n- **Filter Agent Reasoning**: The filter_reasoning field provides valuable context about the filtering decision.

analyze, average allocation per stock: ~$4,522\n- Need to ensure sum of all positive cash changes ≤ $10,949.62\n- Need to ensure sum of all target amounts ≤ $94,955.7\n\nKey observations:\n1. Several large concentrations: V ($7,256.89, 8.6%), JPM ($7,156.19, 8.5%), AMZN ($7,465.11, 8.9%), MSFT ($5,922.71, 7.1%)\n2. Recent market volatility with economic recession concerns (35% probability per Goldman)\n3. Multiple stocks with declining trends requiring fundamental validation\n4. Several defensive positions (UNH, JNJ, PG) with strong dividend profiles\n5. Technical breakdowns in CRM, GS, AMZN\n\nRisk Assessment:\n- Economic recession risk high (GS indicates 35% probability)\n- Large position concentrations in V, JPM, AMZN create concentration risk\n- Technical breakdowns in CRM (6.4% drop), GS (5.5% drop), AMZN (5.5% drop)\n- JNJ abnormal 7.6% single-day drop requires monitoring\n\nStrategy:\n1. Reduce positions with highest risk: GS (economic sensitivity), CRM (technical breakdown)\n2. Maintain defensive positions (JNJ, UNH, PG) \n3. Keep stable technical positions (HD, MCD, SHW, TRV, HON, IBM, AAPL)\n4. Monitor large concentrations (V, JPM, AMZN, MSFT)\n5.
