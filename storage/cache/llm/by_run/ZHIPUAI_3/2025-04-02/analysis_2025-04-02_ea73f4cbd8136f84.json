validation\n- **MSFT**: Moderate volatility between 395.16 and 375.39, but position size (7.1% of portfolio) elevates risk assessment needs\n- **V**: Moderate volatility but large position (8.6% of portfolio) requires fundamental risk justification\n- **CAT**: Declining trend from 342.62 to 330.57 (~3.4% decline) in context of policy-related news\n- **CRM**: Significant decline from 288.61 to 270.2 (~6.4% drop) indicating technical breakdown\n- **JPM**: Declining trend with large position (8.5% of portfolio) creating concentration risk\n- **AMZN**: Significant decline from 205.71 to 190.26 (~7.5% drop) with large position (8.9% of portfolio)\n- **JNJ**: Sharp drop from 165.84 to 153.25 (~7.6% single-day decline) indicating technical anomaly\n\n**News Impact Assessment:**\n- **GS**: Critical economic news with Goldman Sachs raising recession probability to 35% due to tariff policies - requires fundamental economic impact analysis\n- **MSFT**: Major corporate development with

reshoring - requires fundamental analysis of trade impact\n- **PG**: Earnings-related news with Deutsche Bank suggesting potential outlook downgrade due to weak demand - needs fundamental validation\n- **AMGN**: Biosimilar development news with RDY & Bio-Thera deal for JNJ competitors - industry dynamics require fundamental review\n\n**Position Risk Management:**\n- Large positions (>7% portfolio) requiring fundamental review: V (8.6%), JPM (8.5%), AMZN (8.9%)\n- MSFT at 7.1% also approaches concentration threshold\n- These positions represent significant portfolio exposure that demands fundamental justification\n\n**Technical Anomalies:**\n- **JNJ**: 7.6% single-day drop represents unusual volatility exceeding 2σ from recent patterns\n- **CRM**: Sustained 6.4% decline over period indicates breakdown\n- **GS**: High volatility pattern with multiple sharp movements\n- **AMZN**: Significant downward momentum requiring fundamental validation\n\n**Historical Context:**\n- **UNH**: Recent systematic position reductions (from 16.5 shares to 4.76 shares) suggest fundamental concerns\n- **GS**: Recent decrease actions align with concerning economic outlook\n- Multiple stocks showing consistent hold patterns without fundamental triggers\n</ANALYSIS>\n\n<FILTER_RESULT>\n{\n  \"stocks_need_fundamental\": [\"GS\", \"MSFT\", \"V\", \"CAT\", \"CRM\", \"JPM\", \"AMZN\",
