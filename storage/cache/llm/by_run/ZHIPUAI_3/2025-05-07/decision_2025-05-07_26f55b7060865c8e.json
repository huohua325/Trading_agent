Use comprehensive analysis combining technical, fundamental, and news data.\n\n- **Stocks WITHOUT fundamental_data**: These stocks were deemed suitable for technical analysis only. The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\"). Focus analysis on:\n  * Technical indicators and price patterns from market_data\n  * News sentiment and events from news_events  \n  * Position management and risk factors from position_state\n  * Historical decision consistency from history\n\n- **Filter Agent Reasoning**: The filter_reasoning field provides valuable context about the filtering decision.

Technical Trends:\n- MSFT: Strong 10.8% breakout (391.16→433.31) with fundamental validation required\n- CAT: Steady 4.5% uptrend (307.06→320.89) with reasonable PE 23.43\n- AAPL: Concerning 5.5% decline (210.14→198.51) despite Q1 beat\n- Most others: Stable consolidation patterns within normal ranges\n\nFundamental Analysis (where available):\n- MSFT: PE 37.17 (high for growth stock), $3.79T market cap, OpenAI developments\n- CAT: PE 23.43 (reasonable), $220B market cap, Q1 earnings positive\n- MCD: PE 25.81, sales decline 3.5% YoY, consumer pressure\n- UNH: PE 14.92 (attractive), but 26% decline and cyberattack controversy\n- AAPL: PE 37.67 (high), Q1 beat but recent price weakness\n\nRisk Assessment:\n- MSFT breakout requires fundamental validation due to OpenAI events\n- CAT showing consistent momentum with solid fundamentals\n- AAPL decline despite strong earnings suggests valuation concerns\n- UNH position closure appropriate given corporate governance issues\n- Portfolio concentration reasonable with largest positions under 10%\n\nCash Allocation Plan:\n- Available cash: $24,553.77\n- Target increases: MSFT (+$984 to $7,500), CAT (+$992 to $3,500)\n- Total cash needed: $1,976 (8% of available cash)\n- Maintains diversification while adding to strongest performers\n\nDecision Logic:\n1. MSFT: Increase - technical breakout + fundamental validation opportunity\n2. CAT: Increase - steady uptrend + reasonable valuation + Q1 earnings support\n3.
