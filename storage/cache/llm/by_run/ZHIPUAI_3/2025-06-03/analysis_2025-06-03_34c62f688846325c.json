risks, and concentration concerns:\n\n**Market Signals Assessment:**\n- Most stocks show normal volatility patterns within expected ranges\n- No extreme technical anomalies detected (>2σ movements)\n- CRM shows notable decline (283→261) but within technical analysis range\n- TRV approaching 52-week high presents valuation inflection point\n\n**News Impact Analysis:**\n- GS: Multiple significant corporate events (leveraged finance outlook, new fund launch, regulatory changes)\n- V: Regulatory concerns (swipe fees legislation), fintech sector slowdown, geopolitical risks\n- UNH: Major corporate crisis (CEO downfall, class action lawsuit)\n- AMGN: Critical clinical trial results (40% death risk reduction in SCLC)\n- AAPL: Potential policy impact from Trump administration manufacturing requirements\n\n**Position Risk Management:**\n- Large positions requiring fundamental validation: V (8.6%), MSFT (8.8%), CAT (8.4%), JNJ (7.4%), TRV (6.8%), HON (6.4%)\n- Portfolio concentration risk with multiple positions >6% allocation\n- Extended holding periods (50-66 days) increase fundamental review necessity\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- High conviction positions (JNJ recent increase to 6000) warrant fundamental validation\n- Regulatory and geopolitical events require fundamental context beyond technical analysis\n- Clinical trial outcomes and corporate
