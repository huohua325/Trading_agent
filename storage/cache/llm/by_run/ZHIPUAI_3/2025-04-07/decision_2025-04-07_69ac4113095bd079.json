each\n- Market experiencing significant volatility from tariff impacts, tech selloff, and banking earnings uncertainty\n\nKey observations:\n1. Financial sector stress (GS, V, JPM, AXP all declining 10-15%)\n2. Tech selloff affecting MSFT, AMZN, AAPL\n3. Defensive stocks (HD, PG, JNJ, MCD) showing relative stability\n4.

Hold current position.\n\nMSFT: Tech selloff impact but strong AI positioning and nuclear investments. Hold position.\n\nHD: Defensive with 38-year dividend history, moderate decline. Opportunity to increase defensive position.\n\nV: 10.5% decline with high PE (32.12) as large position (8.6% portfolio).

Hold position.\n\nJNJ: Healthcare defensive with recent increases. Hold position.\n\nCash allocation plan:\n- Reduce V by $2,000 (from $6,382.74 to $4,382.74)\n- Reduce JPM by $2,000 (from $6,094.91 to $4,094.91)\n- Increase HD by $1,000 (from $3,894.03 to $4,894.03)\n- Net cash increase: $3,000 (stays within available cash)\n- Total position value after adjustments: $73,353.29 (within total assets limit)\n\nThis rebalancing reduces financial sector
