Use comprehensive analysis combining technical, fundamental, and news data.\n\n- **Stocks WITHOUT fundamental_data**: These stocks were deemed suitable for technical analysis only. The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\"). Focus analysis on:\n  * Technical indicators and price patterns from market_data\n  * News sentiment and events from news_events  \n  * Position management and risk factors from position_state\n  * Historical decision consistency from history\n\n- **Filter Agent Reasoning**: The filter_reasoning field provides valuable context about the filtering decision.

Available cash: $7,474.01, 21 stocks\n- Average allocation per stock: $4,391.04\n- Portfolio is well-diversified across sectors (tech, finance, healthcare, industrial, consumer)\n- Current position sizes range from $1,137.73 (AAPL) to $6,943.68 (JNJ)\n\nKey Observations:\n1. Stocks with fundamental_data require deeper analysis due to technical anomalies or significant news\n2. Several stocks showing strong momentum (MSFT, SHW, IBM, HON)\n3. Some stocks facing headwinds (AAPL decline, UNH weakness, MCD sector concerns)\n4. High dividend yields provide downside protection (AMGN 331.93%, JNJ 294.48%)\n\nRisk Assessment:\n- Technical risks: AAPL 5% decline, UNH downtrend\n- Fundamental risks: High PE ratios (MSFT 37.17, AAPL 37.67, IBM 43.0)\n- Position concentration: JNJ at 8.2% is largest but justified by fundamentals\n\nCash Allocation Strategy:\n- Available cash: $7,474.01\n- Target selective increases in high-conviction stocks\n- Maintain most positions to preserve diversification\n- Focus on stocks with strong momentum and reasonable valuations\n\nDecision Logic:\n1. MSFT: Strong 11% breakout with reasonable fundamentals despite high PE\n2. IBM: AI/quantum catalysts with 7.2% upside, high PE but growth narrative\n3. AAPL: Oversold on bond offering news, good entry point\n4.
