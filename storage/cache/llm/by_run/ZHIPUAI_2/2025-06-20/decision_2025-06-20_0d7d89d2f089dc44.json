Total assets: $97,067.20, Available cash: $730.73 (extremely limited)\n- 22 stocks, average allocation ~$4,412 per stock\n- Portfolio is nearly fully invested with minimal cash for new positions\n\nKey Observations:\n1. Cash constraint severely limits ability to increase positions\n2. Several stocks have fundamental data requiring deeper analysis (GS, MSFT, V, MCD, UNH, AXP, AMGN, CRM, IBM, BA, AMZN, AAPL)\n3. Recent price trends show mixed performance across sectors\n4. Some stocks facing significant headwinds (MCD with GLP-1 concerns, BA with legal issues)\n5. Several stocks showing positive momentum (GS with regulatory changes, IBM with quantum computing)\n\nRisk Assessment:\n- High concentration in some positions (MSFT 10.2%, JNJ 10.0%)\n- Limited cash reduces portfolio flexibility\n- Several stocks facing fundamental challenges\n\nDecision Strategy:\n- Focus on maintaining existing positions due to cash constraints\n- Only modest increases in highest conviction opportunities\n- Consider reducing positions with significant fundamental headwinds\n- Preserve cash for any major opportunities\n\nResource Allocation:\n- Total available for
