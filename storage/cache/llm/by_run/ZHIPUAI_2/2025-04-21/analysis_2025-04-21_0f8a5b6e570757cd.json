several large holdings requiring fundamental risk validation\n- UNH exhibits extreme technical anomaly with 24% price collapse (599.47→454.11) in close_7d pattern, exceeding 2σ volatility threshold\n- MSFT shows concerning downtrend (390.49→367.78) with Azure performance concerns noted in news\n- Several stocks (PG, MCD, JNJ) represent large position concentrations (>8% of portfolio) requiring fundamental justification\n\nNews Impact Assessment:\n- Multiple dividend announcements (TRV, IBM, PG) represent corporate actions requiring fundamental validation\n- BA faces direct tariff war impact on Chinese airline sales - material business risk\n- AMZN making \"urgent moves\" to avoid trade war impact suggests strategic business response\n- CRM experiencing insider selling ($13M) despite analyst downgrades on AI strategy\n- UNH described as having \"one of the worst days in history\" - major negative event\n\nPosition Risk Evaluation:\n- PG represents largest position at 9.6% of portfolio ($6,754.83) - concentration risk requires fundamental backing\n- MCD at 8.9% ($6,254.21) with explicit overvaluation concerns in news\n- JNJ at 8.0% ($5,632.85) large position in defensive sector\n- AMGN at 8.2% ($5,745.45) showing declining price trend\n\nHistorical Context:\n- Recent trading actions show decreases in MSFT, MCD, AMGN suggesting existing concerns\n- UNH holding pattern despite massive price drop indicates need for fundamental reassessment\n- PG recent increases with high confidence (0.85) require fundamental validation for continued allocation\n\nBased on strict professional criteria, 7 stocks clearly require fundamental analysis due to meeting multiple thresholds simultaneously.\n</ANALYSIS>\n\n<FILTER_RESULT>\n{\n  \"stocks_need_fundamental\": [\"UNH\",
