Use comprehensive analysis combining technical, fundamental, and news data.\n\n- **Stocks WITHOUT fundamental_data**: These stocks were deemed suitable for technical analysis only. The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\"). Focus analysis on:\n  * Technical indicators and price patterns from market_data\n  * News sentiment and events from news_events  \n  * Position management and risk factors from position_state\n  * Historical decision consistency from history\n\n- **Filter Agent Reasoning**: The filter_reasoning field provides valuable context about the filtering decision.

value: $84,817.06\n- Number of stocks: 22\n- Average allocation per stock: $4,213.83\n\nKey Observations:\n1. Portfolio is 91.5% invested with only 8.5% cash - high allocation\n2. Several positions showing concerning patterns (MCD earnings miss, UNH decline, AAPL peak/decline)\n3. IBM showing strong uptrend with quantum computing catalysts\n4. Most positions stable with minor movements\n5. Cash constraint limits significant position changes\n\nRisk Assessment:\n- Concentration risk: Several large positions (JPM $6,673, JNJ $7,026, V $6,527)\n- Sector diversification appears adequate across financials, tech, healthcare, consumer\n- Recent volatility in some positions requires monitoring\n\nDecision Strategy:\n- Conservative approach given high allocation and limited cash\n- Focus on IBM for potential increase (strong uptrend, catalyst, small position)\n- Hold most positions due to cash constraints and mixed signals\n- Consider decreasing MCD due to earnings miss and consumer concerns\n- Maintain portfolio stability while managing risk\n\nCash Allocation Planning:\n- Only one realistic increase opportunity: IBM from $2,130 to $3,000 (+$870)\n- This respects cash constraints while allowing selective opportunistic addition\n- Remaining positions maintained at current levels\n</THINK>\n\n<DECISION>\n{\n  \"decisions\": {\n    \"GS\": {\n      \"action\":
