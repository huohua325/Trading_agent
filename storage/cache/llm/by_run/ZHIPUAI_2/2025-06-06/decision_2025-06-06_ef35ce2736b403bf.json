Use comprehensive analysis combining technical, fundamental, and news data.\n\n- **Stocks WITHOUT fundamental_data**: These stocks were deemed suitable for technical analysis only. The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\"). Focus analysis on:\n  * Technical indicators and price patterns from market_data\n  * News sentiment and events from news_events  \n  * Position management and risk factors from position_state\n  * Historical decision consistency from history\n\n- **Filter Agent Reasoning**: The filter_reasoning field provides valuable context about the filtering decision.

($630.73 to current ~$295)\n- CRM: Well below 52-week high ($369 to current ~$267)\n- MSFT: Steady uptrend despite losing market cap crown to NVDA\n- AMZN: Stable upward trend\n- JNJ: Positive pipeline news\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- Regulatory risks: V (EU antitrust), UNH (healthcare regulations)\n- Integration risks: CRM (Informatica acquisition)\n- Concentration risk: AMZN (8% of

Reducing high-risk positions (V, UNH)\n2. Adding to undervalued opportunities (JNJ with positive news)\n3. Maintaining core positions with good technicals (MSFT, AMZN)\n4. Using freed cash from reductions for strategic increases\n</THINK>\n\n<DECISION>\n{\n  \"decisions\": {\n    \"GS\": {\n      \"action\": \"hold\",\n      \"reasons\": [\n        \"Technical pattern
