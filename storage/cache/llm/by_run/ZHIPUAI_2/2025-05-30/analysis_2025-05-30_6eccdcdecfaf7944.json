exhibits elevated volatility from $321.58 to $298.17 (7.3% swing)\n- BA shows increased volatility around $200 level\n- Most technical patterns are stable and within normal ranges\n\n**News Impact Analysis:**\n- GS: Major 1MDB scandal sentencing and Moody's US downgrade impact - significant fundamental events\n- HD: Earnings concerns, housing market deterioration, tariff pressures - material business headwinds\n- TRV: $2.4 billion Canadian business sale - major corporate action requiring fundamental review\n- CRM: Earnings announcement and $8 billion Informatica acquisition - material corporate events\n- AAPL: Trade war tensions, antitrust concerns, OS rebranding - significant strategic developments\n- BA: Jim Cramer comments, Airbus competition, production ramp challenges - industry dynamics\n- CAT: Listed in dividend aristocrats coverage but no material news\n- HON: Minimal news, stable technicals\n\n**Position Risk Analysis:**\n- Portfolio concentration: CAT ($7,916, 8.3%), HON ($6,598, 6.9%) approaching allocation thresholds\n- All positions held for extended periods (49-64 days) requiring periodic fundamental review\n- Most positions under 10% allocation except CAT\n\n**Historical Context:**\n- Recent decrease actions on AAPL and BA suggest fundamental concerns\n- Multiple recent increases indicate confidence in selected positions\n- Strategy appears consistent with fundamental-aware approach\n\n**Efficiency Assessment:**\n- Default to technical analysis for routine decisions\n- Trigger fundamental analysis only for specific material events or risks\n- Focus resources on stocks with material news or position concentration concerns\n</ANALYSIS>\n\n<FILTER_RESULT>\n{\n  \"stocks_need_fundamental\": [\"GS\", \"HD\", \"TRV\", \"CRM\", \"AAPL\",
