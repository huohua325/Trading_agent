Use comprehensive analysis combining technical, fundamental, and news data.\n\n- **Stocks WITHOUT fundamental_data**: These stocks were deemed suitable for technical analysis only. The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\"). Focus analysis on:\n  * Technical indicators and price patterns from market_data\n  * News sentiment and events from news_events  \n  * Position management and risk factors from position_state\n  * Historical decision consistency from history\n\n- **Filter Agent Reasoning**: The filter_reasoning field provides valuable context about the filtering decision.

$18,367.19, Position value: $76,663.97\n- 22 stocks to analyze, average allocation per stock: ~$4,319\n- Portfolio shows concentration risk with AMGN ($10,015, 13.1%) and JNJ ($9,286, 12.1%) as largest positions\n- Several stocks showing technical weakness: GS (-10.5% decline), JPM (-9.5% decline), AAPL (-8.5% decline)\n- Cash constraints: Total positive cash changes must ≤ $18,367.19, total target amounts must ≤ $95,031.15\n\nKey Technical Analysis:\n- GS: 7-day trend [581.14→535.71] shows significant decline, corporate events (CEO IPO expectations, MD departure) create uncertainty\n- UNH: Stable around $481 but legal investigation mentioned in news creates regulatory risk\n- AMGN: Large position (13.1% of portfolio) with stable technicals but requires fundamental justification\n- JPM: Clear downtrend [250.25→227.9] with 9.5% decline, financial sector exposure concerns\n- AAPL: Declining trend [235.93→216.98] with 8.5% drop plus Justice Department pressure\n- JNJ: Large position (12.1% of portfolio) with slight decline, legal investigation risk\n\nRisk Assessment:\n- Technical risks: Multiple stocks showing significant declines (GS, JPM, AAPL)\n- Concentration risks: AMGN and JNJ represent 25%+ of portfolio\n- Regulatory risks: UNH and JNJ face legal investigations\n- Sector risks: Financials (GS, JPM, AXP) under pressure from tariff policy uncertainty\n\nDecision Strategy:\n1. Reduce exposure to technically weak stocks with corporate uncertainty (GS, JPM)\n2. Maintain defensive positions in stable consumer staples (PG, HD)\n3. Reduce concentration risk in large positions (AMGN, JNJ)\n4. Hold positions with stable technicals and positive fundamentals (MSFT, V, TRV)\n5.
