routine corporate action\n- UNH: Legal investigation announcement - significant regulatory risk\n- AAPL: Regulatory pressure from Justice Department - material business risk\n- JNJ: Legal investigation mentioned - potential regulatory concerns\n- TRV: New product liability coverage launch - strategic business development\n\nPosition Risk Assessment:\n- AMGN: Large position at 13.1% of portfolio ($10,015) - concentration risk requiring fundamental review\n- JNJ: Large position at 12.1% of portfolio ($9,286) - concentration risk requiring fundamental review\n- Most other positions are well-diversified under 8% allocation\n- All positions have consistent 8-day holding periods, no extended holding concerns\n\nPortfolio Concentration Analysis:\n- Total portfolio value $95,031 with 22 positions\n- Top 2 positions (AMGN, JNJ) represent 25.2% of portfolio - significant concentration\n- These large positions require fundamental justification for continued exposure\n\nHistorical
