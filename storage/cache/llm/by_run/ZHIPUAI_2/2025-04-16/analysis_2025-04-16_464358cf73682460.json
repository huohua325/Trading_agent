(462.22-516.87) exceeds normal patterns, gap movements visible\n- MSFT: 10.2% volatility (354.56-390.49) with significant price swings requiring validation\n- AAPL: Extreme 17.5% volatility (172.42-202.52) - highest in portfolio, technical reliability questionable\n- AMZN: 12% volatility (170.66-191.1) with elevated price movements\n- UNH: High 14.2% volatility (524.7-599.47) - technical analysis alone insufficient\n- AXP: 13.3% volatility (231.39-262.36) - unusual movements requiring fundamental context\n- BA: 15.8% volatility but no position - not relevant for current decisions\n- Other stocks show normal volatility ranges within 6-9% - technical patterns sufficient\n\n**News Impact Assessment:**\n- GS: Major earnings beat, record trading quarter - fundamental validation critical\n- MSFT: AI strategic developments, cyber attack allegations - corporate strategy changes\n- CAT: CEO transition, strategic continuity announcement - leadership change requires fundamental review\n- UNH: Q1 earnings preview, momentum analysis - earnings catalyst approaching\n- AXP: Q1 earnings preview, recession play analysis - earnings catalyst approaching\n- AMGN: Patent lawsuit, phase III trial results - material corporate events\n- CRM: Growth guidance concerns - fundamental performance issues\n- JPM: Earnings beat, insider selling by CEO - mixed signals need fundamental context\n- HON: Institutional sale due to uncertainty - fundamental risk assessment needed\n- AMZN: Tariff concerns, analyst notes - macro impact on fundamentals\n- AAPL: Tariff concerns, manufacturing plans - supply chain fundamentals affected\n\n**Position Risk Management:**\n- MSFT: 10.2% portfolio allocation - large position requires fundamental justification\n- PG: 8.5% allocation but low volatility/routine news - technical management adequate\n- AMGN: 8.4% allocation + patent lawsuit - fundamental risk validation needed\n- V: 8.1% allocation but normal patterns - technical sufficient\n- HD: 7.9% allocation but stable - technical adequate\n- HON: 6.4% allocation + institutional concerns - fundamental review needed\n- JNJ: 6.7% allocation but stable - technical sufficient\n\n**Historical Context:**\n- Recent increase in MSFT position (April 15) with high confidence (0.85) - consistency requires fundamental validation\n- GS had recent decrease (April 10) - earnings news may validate/reverse this decision\n- Multiple stocks approaching 32-day holding period - routine review cycle\n- No clear historical patterns of fundamental dependency for most
