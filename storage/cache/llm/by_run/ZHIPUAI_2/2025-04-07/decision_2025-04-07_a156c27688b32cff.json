due to dealmaking freeze concerns\n- Tech stocks hit by China exposure and supply chain risks\n- Defensive sectors showing relative strength\n\nStock Analysis Strategy:\n- Stocks WITH fundamental_data: Use comprehensive analysis (GS, CAT, AXP, JPM, BA, AAPL)\n- Stocks WITHOUT fundamental_data: Focus on technicals, news sentiment, position management\n\nCritical Resource Allocation:\n- Available cash: $22,657.03 must fund all increases\n- 20 stocks = ~$1,133 average available per stock for increases\n- Prioritize defensive positions and undervalued opportunities\n- Avoid over-concentration in any single position\n\nRisk Assessment:\n- High concentration risk in financial sector (GS, JPM, AXP all stressed)\n- Tech sector exposure to China tariffs (AAPL, MSFT, AMZN)\n- Industrial sector weakness (CAT, BA)\n- Need defensive positioning (PG, JNJ, MCD, UNH)\n\nDecision Framework:\n1. Reduce exposure to most stressed sectors\n2. Add to defensive positions with strong fundamentals\n3. Maintain core positions in quality companies\n4. Use cash buffer opportunistically\n5.
