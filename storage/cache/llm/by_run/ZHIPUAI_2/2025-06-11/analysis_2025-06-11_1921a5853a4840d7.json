Analysis:**\n- Portfolio shows high concentration (96.8% invested) with minimal cash buffer\n- Most stocks exhibit stable technical patterns within normal volatility ranges\n- Notable exceptions: MCD showing clear downtrend (300.43 from 312.68), TRV declining (263.0 from 276.34), CAT recovering from lows\n- MSFT and AMZN showing strong upward momentum approaching potential resistance levels\n\n**News Impact Assessment:**\n- Corporate actions requiring fundamental validation: UNH ($1B Latin American unit sale), HON (Sundyne acquisition), PG (7,000 job cuts)\n- Regulatory concerns: JNJ (vaccine panel changes, RFK Jr. policy impact)\n- Analyst downgrades: MCD (Morgan Stanley downgrade, pricing power erosion)\n- Sector pressures: CAT (sixth straight quarter of volume declines)\n\n**Position Risk Evaluation:**\n- Large positions (>6% portfolio) requiring fundamental review: JNJ (9.6%), MSFT (9.0%), AMZN (8.9%), GS (8.6%), AMGN (8.0%), HON (6.9%), PG (6.9%), CAT (6.4%), JPM (6.4%)\n- Extended holding periods (72 days) across most positions suggest fundamental review is warranted for large exposures\n- Portfolio concentration risk high with minimal cash flexibility\n\n**Historical Context Review:**\n- Recent position increases in MSFT, AMZN, JNJ indicate confidence in fundamental thesis\n- Decreases in CAT, MCD, TRV suggest risk management response to changing fundamentals\n- Consistent \"hold\" actions for most stocks indicate stable technical management approach\n</ANALYSIS>\n\n<FILTER_RESULT>\n{\n  \"stocks_need_fundamental\": [\"MSFT\",
