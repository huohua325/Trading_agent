The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\"). Focus analysis on:\n  * Technical indicators and price patterns from market_data\n  * News sentiment and events from news_events  \n  * Position management and risk factors from position_state\n  * Historical decision consistency from history\n\n- **Filter Agent Reasoning**: The filter_reasoning field provides valuable context about the filtering decision.

Major concentration risks: JPM (11.3%), GS (10.9%), AMGN (8.3%), PG (7.4%)\n- Recent significant position increases in GS and JPM on 4/23\n\nStock Analysis:\n\n**Stocks WITH Fundamental Data:**\n\nGS: Large position (10.9%) with technical breakout to 529 from 503 range. PE 15.8 reasonable, but dividend yield data appears erroneous (198.43%). Filter agent flags as requiring fundamental validation due to size and breakout. Already increased significantly on 4/23. HOLD to manage concentration risk.\n\nMSFT: Declining trend (387→374), high PE 37.17, antitrust concerns. Already decreased recently. HOLD current reduced position.\n\nHD: Range-bound (345-357), PE 27.69 moderate, strong dividend 223.89. Tariff concerns from Trump meetings. HOLD moderate position.\n\nSHW: Downtrend (341→331), high PE 33.93, earnings next week. Small position, HOLD pending earnings.\n\nCAT: Commodity-driven news affecting machinery orders, downtrend from 52-week high 485 to current 295. PE 23.43 reasonable. HOLD small position.\n\nUNH: Extreme technical anomaly with 22% single-day drop (587→427). Low PE 14.92 but security spending concerns. Position already reduced significantly. HOLD small position.\n\nJPM: Largest position (11.3%), technical breakout (234→240), investor day approaching. Already increased on 4/23. HOLD to avoid further concentration.\n\nPG: Range-bound (165-170), earnings Thursday, large position (7.4%). PE 22.39 reasonable, strong dividend 277.18. HOLD pending earnings.\n\nAMGN: Downtrend (293→277), large position (8.3%), PE 23.33 reasonable, strong dividend 331.93. HOLD but monitor for further weakness.\n\n**Stocks WITHOUT Fundamental Data (Technical focus):**\n\nV: Recovery from 320 support to 334, moderate position. Technicals adequate. HOLD.\n\nMCD: Range-bound (308-319), governance concerns but Wells Fargo top pick. HOLD moderate position.\n\nAXP: Recovery from 242 support to 260, macro concerns priced in. HOLD small position.\n\nTRV: Stable range-bound trading, no material news. HOLD.\n\nCRM: Volatility within normal range for tech, small position. HOLD.\n\nIBM: Steady uptrend (239→245), positive analyst commentary. HOLD small position.\n\nHON: Range-bound trading, moderate position. HOLD.\n\nBA: Recovery from 159 to 172, no position currently. HOLD.\n\nAMZN: Recovery from 167 to 180, analyst downgrade priced in. HOLD small position.\n\nAAPL: Recovery from 193 support to 204, small position. HOLD.\n\nJNJ: Stable trading pattern, large but stable position. HOLD.\n\nCash Constraints:\n- Available cash: $20,074.89\n- With 23 stocks, average allocation should be ~$3,910\n- Several positions already above average (JPM, GS, AMGN, PG)\n- Conservative approach: maintain current positions, preserve cash for better opportunities\n\nRisk Management:\n- Reduce exposure to largest positions (JPM, GS) through natural attrition\n- Monitor earnings stocks (SHW, PG) closely\n- Technical anomalies (UNH drop) already addressed with position reduction\n- No new allocations until risk profile improves\n</THINK>\n\n<DECISION>\n{\n  \"decisions\": {\n
