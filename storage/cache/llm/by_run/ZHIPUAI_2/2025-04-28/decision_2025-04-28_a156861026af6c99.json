The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\").

with tariff concerns (MSFT, AMZN, AAPL)\n- Financial sector exposure to private credit risks (GS, JPM)\n- Consumer stress indicators (PG revenue disappointment)\n\nOpportunities:\n- Strong technical recoveries (MSFT 9.1%, AMZN 12.9%, GS 9.2%)\n- Positive clinical data (JNJ TAR-200 trials)\n- Earnings beats (IBM)\n- Stable dividend players\n\nCash Allocation Strategy:\n- Prioritize reducing high-risk positions (UNH)\n- Add to high-conviction technical recoveries with reasonable fundamentals\n- Maintain defensive exposure\n- Reserve cash for earnings volatility\n\nPortfolio Rebalancing:\n- Reduce UNH position due to severe technical breakdown and fundamental issues\n- Add to MSFT and AMZN given strong recoveries and market leadership\n- Maintain or modestly increase GS
