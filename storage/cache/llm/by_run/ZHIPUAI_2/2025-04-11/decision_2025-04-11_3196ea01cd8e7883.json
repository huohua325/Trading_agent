The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\").

Tariff impacts on supply chains (AAPL, AMZN, BA)\n2. Pharmaceutical tariff threats (AMGN, JNJ)\n3. Upcoming earnings (GS, MSFT, V, JPM)\n4. Corporate governance issues (HON)\n5. Regulatory uncertainty (UNH)\n\nCash Allocation Strategy:\n- Preserve most cash ($25,814.99) given market uncertainty\n- Only make selective increases in high-conviction defensive positions\n- Maintain current positions through earnings announcements\n- Focus on risk management given elevated volatility\n\nPosition-by-Position Analysis:\n- GS: Small position ($1,027), Q1 earnings approaching, high volatility - HOLD\n- MSFT: Large position ($5,302), April 30 earnings, high valuation - HOLD\n- HD: Stable position ($5,290), no major events - HOLD\n- V: Large position ($5,308), April 29 earnings, high volatility - HOLD\n- SHW: Small position ($1,394), recent earnings completed - HOLD\n- CAT: Moderate position ($1,693), dividend stability - HOLD\n- MCD: Largest position ($6,175), stable defensive - HOLD\n- UNH: Moderate position ($3,133), regulatory uncertainty - HOLD\n- AXP: Small position ($1,973), high volatility - HOLD\n- AMGN: Large position ($5,435), pharma tariff risk - HOLD\n- TRV: Moderate position ($3,050), high volatility - HOLD\n- CRM: Small position ($1,912), earnings completed - HOLD\n- JPM: Moderate position ($3,236), Q1 earnings today - HOLD\n- IBM: Small position ($1,388), minor governance issues - HOLD\n- HON: Large position ($4,243), governance issues - HOLD\n- BA: No position, previously closed - STAY CLOSED\n- AMZN: Moderate position ($2,776), supply chain risk - HOLD\n- AAPL: Small position ($1,131), extreme volatility - HOLD\n- PG: Large position ($5,030), defensive with dividend increase - INCREASE SLIGHTLY\n- JNJ: Large position ($4,363), regulatory/pharma risks - HOLD\n\nStrategic Decision:\nGiven the market volatility and upcoming earnings, the primary strategy is risk preservation. Only PG shows clear defensive characteristics with recent dividend increase and stable pattern warranting a small increase.
