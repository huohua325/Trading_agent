analysis:\n\n**Market Signals Analysis:**\n- High volatility patterns identified in GS (11.8% swing), UNH (14.2% swing), AXP (13.3% swing), TRV (12.5% swing), JPM (12.3% swing), HON (13.0% swing), BA (17.8% swing), AMZN (11.9% swing), and AAPL (17.8% swing)\n- These volatility levels exceed normal technical analysis reliability thresholds\n- Multiple stocks showing gap movements and unusual price patterns requiring validation\n\n**News Impact Assessment:**\n- Corporate earnings announcements: GS, UNH, TRV, JNJ mentioned in earnings news\n- Tariff-related impacts: MSFT, V, CAT, AXP, AMZN, AAPL

positions held 30 days, requiring periodic fundamental review\n- Portfolio concentration: Several positions approaching allocation thresholds\n\n**Historical Context:**\n- Recent position changes indicate active management\n- Multiple stocks with recent increase/decrease actions suggesting fundamental reassessment\n- Decision confidence levels vary, indicating mixed signal reliability\n\n**Filtering Decision:**\nBased on the efficiency-first principle, I'll identify stocks where fundamental analysis is critical for sound decision-making, focusing on those with clear technical anomalies, material news events, or significant position risks.\n</ANALYSIS>\n\n<FILTER_RESULT>\n{\n  \"stocks_need_fundamental\": [\"GS\", \"MSFT\", \"V\", \"CAT\", \"UNH\", \"AXP\",
