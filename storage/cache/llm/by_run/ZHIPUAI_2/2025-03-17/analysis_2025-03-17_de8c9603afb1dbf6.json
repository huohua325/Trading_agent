Impact Evaluation:\n- Sector-specific catalysts identified: banking (GS tariff/crypto news), retail (HD tariffs), tech (MSFT AI energy, CRM Singapore investment, AAPL AI delays)\n- Corporate governance events: AXP shareholder proposals on DEI policies\n- Earnings-related analysis: SHW post-earnings assessment\n- Industry developments: defense contracting (BA), AI infrastructure (MSFT, AMZN)\n\nPosition Risk Assessment:\n- Portfolio concentration analysis identifies three positions >8%: MSFT (9%), AMGN (10.3%), JNJ (10.2%)\n- Recent position reductions indicate risk management: GS, HD, SHW, AAPL, AXP, JPM all decreased from larger positions\n- Extended holding period (10 days across all positions) requires fundamental validation for larger exposures\n\nHistorical Context Review:\n- Decision patterns show consistent risk management with position size reductions\n- Strategy consistency indicates fundamental dependency for concentration management\n- Previous large position reductions (UNH to minimal) demonstrate risk-aware approach\n\nProfessional Criteria Application:\n- Technical anomalies: AAPL volatility exceeds 2σ threshold\n- News-driven events: GS
