Use comprehensive analysis combining technical, fundamental, and news data.\n\n- **Stocks WITHOUT fundamental_data**: These stocks were deemed suitable for technical analysis only. The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\"). Focus analysis on:\n  * Technical indicators and price patterns from market_data\n  * News sentiment and events from news_events  \n  * Position management and risk factors from position_state\n  * Historical decision consistency from history\n\n- **Filter Agent Reasoning**: The filter_reasoning field provides valuable context about the filtering decision.

Analysis:\n- Total assets: $95,188.22 with only $5,364.88 available cash (5.6% cash ratio)\n- Current position value: $89,823.34 across 22 stocks\n- Average allocation per stock: $4,082 (current average position size)\n- Portfolio is well-diversified but cash-constrained\n\nKey Market Observations:\n- Recent market rally with Dow surging over 1000 points\n- \"Magnificent 7\" stocks showing strength\n- Multiple technical breakouts identified (GS 7.6%, AMZN 8.1%, AAPL 6.2%, BA 7.1%)\n- Mixed fundamental picture with some defensive concerns (MCD earnings miss, PG revenue decline)\n\nRisk Assessment:\n- Limited cash restricts ability to capitalize on breakouts\n- Several stocks facing headwinds (UNH lawsuit, MCD consumer weakness, PG tariff pressures)\n- High valuation stocks (CRM PE 35.46, IBM PE 43.0) require caution\n- Defensive positioning through dividend stocks (JNJ, PG, AMGN) provides stability\n\nCash Allocation Strategy:\nWith only $5,364.88 available across 22 stocks, average additional allocation would be $244 per stock. Given this constraint and the need to maintain liquidity, a conservative HOLD strategy is most appropriate. The portfolio already has reasonable exposure to breakout stocks and maintaining current positions allows participation in upside while preserving capital for better opportunities.\n\nPosition Analysis:\n- Strong performers: GS, AMZN, AAPL showing breakouts but positions already substantial\n- Stable holdings: MSFT, V, JPM, PG, JNJ providing consistent performance\n- Monitoring required: UNH (legal issues), MCD (consumer weakness), IBM (AI survey concerns)\n- Technical anomalies validated: Filter reasoning suggests most price movements are justified\n\nDecision Logic:\nGiven cash constraints and mixed market signals, HOLD all positions to:\n1. Preserve limited liquidity for better opportunities\n2. Allow current breakout positions to develop\n3. Maintain diversification while monitoring risks\n4. Avoid over-concentration in any single position\n</THINK>\n\n<DECISION>\n{\n  \"decisions\": {\n    \"GS\": {\n      \"action\": \"hold\",\n      \"reasons\": [\n        \"Technical breakout validated
