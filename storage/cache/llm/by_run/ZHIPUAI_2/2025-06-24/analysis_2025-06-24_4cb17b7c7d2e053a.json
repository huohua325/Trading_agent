fundamental analysis requirements based on market signals, news events, position risk, and historical context.\n\nMarket Signals Analysis:\n- Most stocks show normal volatility patterns within acceptable ranges\n- AMGN shows significant price drop (-8.4% over 7 days) requiring fundamental validation\n- V exhibits high volatility (338.57-371.4 range) beyond normal patterns\n- Several stocks show stable technical patterns suitable for technical-only analysis\n\nNews Impact Assessment:\n- GS: Strategic expansion into private equity credit lines represents material business development\n- MSFT: OpenAI-Google Cloud partnership is a significant competitive development\n- HD: Mixed news about growth catalysts and margin concerns affects outlook\n- V: Crypto integration and regulatory changes require fundamental risk assessment\n- CAT: Upcoming Investor Day indicates potential strategic changes\n- UNH: Regulatory changes in prior authorization affect business model\n- AMGN: Drug trial adverse events directly impact pipeline valuation\n- IBM: Credit agreement restructuring and AI-fueled rally validation needed\n- AMZN: AI/quantum infrastructure investments affect long-term

concentration risk identified with positions >8%: JNJ (9.9%), MSFT (10.4%), AMZN (9.3%), AMGN (8.0%), GS (9.6%)\n- Large positions with material news catalysts require fundamental validation\n- Extended holding periods (81 days) for major positions necessitate fundamental review\n\nHistorical Context Review:\n- Recent increase actions in GS, MSFT, AMGN, IBM, AMZN, AAPL indicate growth positions needing fundamental support\n- Decrease actions in V, SHW, MCD suggest risk management requiring fundamental validation\n- Consistent holds in many stocks with stable patterns don't require fundamental analysis\n\nEfficiency Principle Applied:\n- Default to technical analysis for stocks with stable patterns and no material news\n- Require fundamental analysis only when specific criteria are met: material news, technical anomalies, large positions with catalysts, or significant price movements\n</ANALYSIS>\n\n<FILTER_RESULT>\n{\n  \"stocks_need_fundamental\": [\"GS\", \"MSFT\",
