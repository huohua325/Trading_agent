Use comprehensive analysis combining technical, fundamental, and news data.\n\n- **Stocks WITHOUT fundamental_data**: These stocks were deemed suitable for technical analysis only. The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\"). Focus analysis on:\n  * Technical indicators and price patterns from market_data\n  * News sentiment and events from news_events  \n  * Position management and risk factors from position_state\n  * Historical decision consistency from history\n\n- **Filter Agent Reasoning**: The filter_reasoning field provides valuable context about the filtering decision.

"\n<THINK>\nPortfolio Analysis:\n- Total assets: $97,695.84 with only $457.07 available cash (0.5% cash ratio)\n- 22 stocks with average allocation of $4,440.72 per stock\n- Portfolio is fully invested with minimal liquidity\n- Position concentration: Largest positions are JNJ (9.9%), MSFT (10.4%), GS (9.6%), AMZN (9.3%)\n\nCash Constraints:\n- Extremely limited cash availability ($457.07)\n- Any buying decisions must be minimal and highly selective\n- Portfolio management focus should be on risk preservation rather than expansion\n\nStock Analysis Summary:\n1. **GS**: Strong 7-day momentum (+3.5%), private equity expansion news, reasonable PE 15.8, large position (9.6%)\n2. **MSFT**: Moderate momentum (+1.5%), OpenAI-Google partnership news, high PE 37.17, largest position (10.4%)\n3. **HD**: Flat trend, mixed news on growth catalysts, reasonable PE 27.69\n4. **V**: Volatile pattern, crypto integration news, regulatory concerns, recent position decreases\n5. **SHW**: Declining trend (-3.5%), minimal news, small position\n6. **CAT**: Slight uptrend (+1.5%), upcoming Investor Day, reasonable PE 23.43\n7. **MCD**: Declining trend (-4.5%), small position (0.5%)\n8. **UNH**: Declining trend (-5.6%), regulatory changes, reasonable PE 14.92\n9. **AXP**: Flat trend, bullish analyst coverage\n10. **AMGN**: Sharp decline (-8.4%), drug trial issues, large position (8.0%)\n11. **TRV**: Extremely stable, non-material news\n12. **CRM**: Small position (0.7%), AI coverage\n13. **JPM**: Uptrend (+3.7%), sector-level news\n14. **IBM**: Uptrend (+2.9%), AI rally, high PE 43.0\n15. **HON**: Extremely stable, narrow range\n16. **BA**: Closed position, legal investigations\n17. **AMZN**: Declining trend (-2.2%), AI/quantum investments, large position (9.3%)\n18. **AAPL**: Slight uptrend (+1.2%), small position (1.8%)\n19. **PG**: Stable, consumer volatility concerns, defensive position (7.2%)\n20. **JNJ**: Stable, drug approvals, largest position (9.9%)\n\nRisk Assessment:\n- AMGN shows concerning -8.4% decline with drug trial issues\n- UNH declining -5.6% with regulatory headwinds\n- Several large positions (MSFT, JNJ, GS, AMZN) near 10% concentration\n- Limited cash prevents meaningful rebalancing\n\nDecision Logic:\nGiven severe cash constraints and full investment, the optimal strategy is HOLD across all positions. The portfolio shows reasonable diversification and most positions are within acceptable risk parameters. The few concerning stocks (AMGN, UNH) don't warrant immediate liquidation given their fundamental strength and position sizes. Any buying would require selling other positions, which isn't justified by current opportunities.\n</THINK>\n\n<DECISION>\n{\n  \"decisions\": {\n    \"GS\": {\n      \"action\": \"hold\",\n
