reasonable valuations\n- Consider small tactical additions to GS, AMGN, JNJ given positive developments\n- BA represents new opportunity but requires caution due to operational risks\n\nRisk Assessment:\n- High concentration in mega-cap tech (MSFT, AMZN)\n- Several positions near 7-10% thresholds\n- Limited cash reduces flexibility\n- Market volatility concerns with recent declines in several stocks\n</THINK>\n\n<DECISION>\n{\n  \"decisions\": {\n    \"GS\": {\n      \"action\": \"increase\",\n      \"target_cash_amount\": 8646.04,\n      \"reasons\": [\n        \"Bank of America
