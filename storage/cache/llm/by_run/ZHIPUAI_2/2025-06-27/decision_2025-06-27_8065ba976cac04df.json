regulatory news\n- MSFT: Approaching 52-week highs, AI developments\n- CAT: Strong momentum (+6.8% in 7 days)\n- JPM: Breaking out (+7.1% in 7 days)\n- AMZN: Recovering from recent lows\n- IBM: Stable around $292\n\nRisk Assessment:\n- UNH: DOJ investigation on PBM unit creates regulatory uncertainty\n- GS: Regulatory changes could impact banking sector\n- BA: Aerospace risks, though position negligible\n- Portfolio concentration risk in top positions\n\nCash Constraints:\n- Only $457.06 available for new investments\n- Must be extremely selective with any purchases\n- Focus on risk
