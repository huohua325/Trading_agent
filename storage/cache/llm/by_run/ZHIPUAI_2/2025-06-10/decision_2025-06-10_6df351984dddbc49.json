Use comprehensive analysis combining technical, fundamental, and news data.\n\n- **Stocks WITHOUT fundamental_data**: These stocks were deemed suitable for technical analysis only. The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\"). Focus analysis on:\n  * Technical indicators and price patterns from market_data\n  * News sentiment and events from news_events  \n  * Position management and risk factors from position_state\n  * Historical decision consistency from history\n\n- **Filter Agent Reasoning**: The filter_reasoning field provides valuable context about the filtering decision.

Need to prioritize risk management and position sizing\n\nKey Risk Factors:\n1. Several stocks with fundamental concerns (CAT volume declines, MCD downgrade)\n2. High concentration risk (CAT 7.3%, JPM 6.1%, JNJ 9.3%, AMGN 7.7%)\n3. Limited cash for opportunistic allocation\n\nStock Analysis:\n\n**CAT**: Six consecutive quarterly volume declines with macro pressures. Recent $1,000 reduction indicates risk management. PE 23.43 reasonable but business deterioration warrants continued caution.\n\n**MCD**: Morgan Stanley downgrade citing structural headwinds. Price declining from $313 to $304. Recent position reduction consistent with fundamental concerns.\n\n**UNH**: Significant sell-off recently but PE 14.92 attractive. New CEO focusing on pricing discipline. Small position ($1,021) provides flexibility.\n\n**CRM**: Aggressive AI acquisitions ($8B Informatica, Moonhub) create integration risk. PE 35.46 high, small position ($533) suggests existing caution.\n\n**HON**: $2.16B Sundyne acquisition completed, expected to be immediately accretive. Solid performance with PE 23.17.\n\n**Technical-only stocks**: Most showing stable patterns suitable for holding, given limited cash and already full portfolio.\n\n**Cash Allocation Strategy**: With only $3,005 available, must be highly selective.
