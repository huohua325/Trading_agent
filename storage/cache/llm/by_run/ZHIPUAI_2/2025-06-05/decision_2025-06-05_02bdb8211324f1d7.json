Use comprehensive analysis combining technical, fundamental, and news data.\n\n- **Stocks WITHOUT fundamental_data**: These stocks were deemed suitable for technical analysis only. The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\"). Focus analysis on:\n  * Technical indicators and price patterns from market_data\n  * News sentiment and events from news_events  \n  * Position management and risk factors from position_state\n  * Historical decision consistency from history\n\n- **Filter Agent Reasoning**: The filter_reasoning field provides valuable context about the filtering decision.

value: $95,578.93 (99% invested)\n- 20 stocks, average allocation should be ~$4,830 per stock\n- Portfolio is nearly fully invested, very selective with increases needed\n\nKey Risk Factors:\n1. Regulatory risks: V (EU fee probe), AAPL (DOJ anti-monopoly), BA (NTSB hearing)\n2. Business model disruptions: CRM (security breach), UNH (Medicare Advantage squeeze)\n3.
