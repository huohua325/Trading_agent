$39.64 available for new purchases\n- Cannot exceed total_assets constraint\n- Must maintain adequate cash reserves\n\nRisk Assessment:\n- High volatility stocks: BA (8.5%), SHW (9%)\n- Stocks with fundamental concerns: MSFT (OpenAI strain), UNH (Medicaid cuts), SHW (housing slump), BA (crash investigation)\n- Stable performers: PG, JNJ, CAT, TRV, AMGN\n\nTechnical Analysis:\n- GS: Modest uptrend from 613.52 to 624.64, stable 2.3% volatility\n- MSFT: Slight downtrend from 479.14 to 478.04, 3.7% volatility\n- SHW: Clear downtrend from 357.95 to 331.03, elevated 9% volatility\n- BA: Declining from 217.51 to 200.26, high 8.5% volatility\n- Most others: Stable patterns with normal volatility\n\nGiven severe cash constraints, I must focus on:\n1. Risk management - reduce exposure to high-risk positions\n2. Portfolio rebalancing - free up cash from overweights\n3. Preserve capital - no new purchases possible\n\nStrategy: Decrease high-risk positions (BA, SHW) and modestly reduce some overweights to improve risk profile and generate minimal cash for
