Use comprehensive analysis combining technical, fundamental, and news data.\n\n- **Stocks WITHOUT fundamental_data**: These stocks were deemed suitable for technical analysis only. The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\"). Focus analysis on:\n  * Technical indicators and price patterns from market_data\n  * News sentiment and events from news_events  \n  * Position management and risk factors from position_state\n  * Historical decision consistency from history\n\n- **Filter Agent Reasoning**: The filter_reasoning field provides valuable context about the filtering decision.

The average allocation per stock should be around $4,373.10.\n\nKey considerations:\n1. Three stocks have fundamental_data due to material risks: UNH (DOJ investigation), AMGN (pharma tariff concerns), BA (737 MAX legal issues)\n2. 19 stocks rely on technical analysis only\n3. Must respect cash constraints and total assets limit\n4. Need to maintain risk diversification across sectors\n\nPortfolio Analysis:\n- Financial sector: GS, JPM, AXP, V (4 positions)\n- Tech sector: MSFT, CRM, IBM, AAPL, AMZN (5 positions) \n- Industrial: CAT, HON, BA (3 positions)\n- Healthcare: UNH, JNJ, AMGN (3 positions)\n- Consumer: HD, MCD, PG (3 positions)\n- Materials: SHW (1 position)\n- Insurance: TRV (1 position)\n\nCurrent position sizes range from $1,508 (IBM) to $5,959 (CAT), with most around $3-5K range.\n\nRisk Assessment:\n- UNH: DOJ investigation creates significant regulatory risk\n- BA: Legal developments with 737 MAX guilty plea withdrawal\n- AMGN: Pharmaceutical sector facing systematic tariff risk\n- Recent market volatility with Dow falls mentioned in news\n\nOpportunities:\n- JPM showing strong momentum (+6.9% in 7 days)\n- AAPL positive trend with AI data center investments\n- MSFT stable with analyst recommendations\n- CRM with AI partnership news\n\nI'll make targeted adjustments to reduce risk in problematic
