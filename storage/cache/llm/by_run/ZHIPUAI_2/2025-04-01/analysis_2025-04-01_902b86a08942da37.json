stocks in normal 2-5% weekly ranges\n- GS shows unusual 7.4% volatility with downward trend requiring fundamental validation\n- CRM and AMZN show higher tech volatility (7% range) but within normal bounds for sector\n- Most stocks display stable technical patterns suitable for technical analysis alone\n\nNews Impact Assessment:\n- GS: Material macro-economic news including recession probability increase to 35%, Trump policy impacts, and insider selling patterns\n- CAT: Significant corporate development with LiDAR technology partnership for automation expansion\n- UNH: Legal investigation of fiduciary duty breaches by directors/officers - material regulatory risk\n- AMGN: Biosimilar competition developments affecting competitive landscape\n- BA: Multi-billion dollar fighter jet contract announcement - material corporate event\n- Other stocks: Routine analyst coverage, momentum analysis, and general market commentary\n\nPosition Risk Analysis:\n- HON represents largest position at 8.9% of portfolio ($7,008.85), approaching concentration threshold\n- Multiple positions in 5-8% range (MSFT, V, CAT, JNJ, AMGN) but within normal allocation limits\n- Recent position changes in GS, UNH, and BA suggest active risk management\n- Most positions held for 21 days indicating stable portfolio composition\n\nHistorical Context:\n- Recent decrease actions in GS (2025-03-31) and UNH (2025-03-31) with high confidence suggest risk concerns\n- BA shows volatile recent decisions (increase/decrease pattern) indicating uncertainty\n- HON recent significant increase (2025-03-31) requires fundamental justification for large exposure\n- Most stocks show consistent hold patterns suggesting technical sufficiency\n\nPortfolio Concentration:\n- Total position value $78,559.32 across 21 stocks indicates reasonable diversification\n- HON as largest position crosses 8% threshold requiring fundamental risk validation\n- No single position exceeds 10% allocation
