Use comprehensive analysis combining technical, fundamental, and news data.\n\n- **Stocks WITHOUT fundamental_data**: These stocks were deemed suitable for technical analysis only. The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\"). Focus analysis on:\n  * Technical indicators and price patterns from market_data\n  * News sentiment and events from news_events  \n  * Position management and risk factors from position_state\n  * Historical decision consistency from history\n\n- **Filter Agent Reasoning**: The filter_reasoning field provides valuable context about the filtering decision.

{"choices": [{"message": {"content": "\n<THINK>\nPortfolio Analysis:\n- Total assets: $96,306.95 with only $1,836.15 available cash\n- 22 stocks in portfolio, average allocation ~$4,377 per stock\n- Portfolio is 98% invested, very limited flexibility for new positions\n- Several large positions: CAT (8.2%), MSFT (7.2%), AMZN (7.3%), V (7%), PG (7%), JNJ (6.3%)\n\nCash Flow Constraints:\n- Available cash: $1,836.15 (must not exceed for all increases combined)\n- Any increases must be conservative given tight cash position\n- Portfolio already highly concentrated with minimal cash buffer\n\nStock Analysis Summary:\n1. GS: CEO governance controversy, 8.6% position size - HOLD\n2. MSFT: Stable 7-day pattern, 7.2% position - HOLD  \n3. HD: Recovering from 5% dip, normal position - HOLD\n4. V: Stable crypto news not material, 7% position - HOLD\n5. SHW: Small position, consolidating pattern - HOLD\n6. CAT: Largest position at 8.2%, recovering - HOLD\n7. MCD: Very stable pattern, promotional news - HOLD\n8. UNH: Critical corporate turmoil, 60% stock drop - HOLD\n9. AXP: Recovering pattern, normal volatility - HOLD\n10. AMGN: Stable with slight uptick, 6% position - HOLD\n11. TRV: Very stable pattern, minimal news - HOLD\n12. CRM: High PE ratio (35.46), upcoming earnings - HOLD\n13. JPM: Stable pattern, 6.2% position - HOLD\n14. IBM: Partnership news positive but slight downtrend - HOLD\n15. HON: Material $1.325B business sale completed, 6.8% position - HOLD\n16. BA: PE ratio 0.0 indicating issues, trade policy uncertainty - HOLD\n17. AMZN: Stable pattern, 7.3% position - HOLD\n18. AAPL: Declining 7-day trend - HOLD\n19. PG: Stable uptrend, 7% position - HOLD\n20. JNJ: Very stable pattern, 6.3% position - HOLD\n21. (Missing stocks in input: Need to check for any additional stocks)\n\nRisk Factors:\n- Multiple stocks with governance/regulatory issues (GS, UNH)\n- High concentration in several positions\n- Limited cash prevents meaningful position increases\n- BA with PE=0 indicates potential financial issues\n- CRM with high PE and upcoming earnings adds uncertainty\n\nDecision Logic:\nGiven the extremely limited cash availability ($1,836.15) and portfolio concentration risks, the optimal strategy is to HOLD all positions. No stock demonstrates sufficient momentum or fundamental strength to justify increasing positions given the cash constraints. Several stocks have specific risk factors (GS governance, UNH regulatory probes, BA financial issues, CRM high valuation) that make increases inappropriate.\n\nHistory Review:\nRecent history shows consistent HOLD decisions across most stocks, with some recent increases in HD, CAT, MCD, TRV, HON, AMZN, JNJ. The strategy has been conservative, which aligns with current risk profile and limited cash availability.\n</THINK>\n\n<DECISION>\n{\n  \"decisions\": {\n    \"GS\": {\n      \"action\": \"hold\",\n
