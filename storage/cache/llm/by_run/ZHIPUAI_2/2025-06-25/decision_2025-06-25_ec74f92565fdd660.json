The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\").

"\n<THINK>\nPortfolio Analysis:\n- Total assets: $98,217.79 with only $457.07 available cash - severely constrained\n- 21 stocks with average allocation of $4,677 each, but highly concentrated\n- Top positions: MSFT (10.4%), JNJ (9.8%), GS (9.7%), AMZN (9.4%)\n- Several stocks have fundamental data based on filter agent's risk assessment\n\nKey Risk Factors:\n1. Extreme concentration in top 4 positions (~39% of portfolio)\n2. Limited cash flexibility for opportunistic adjustments\n3. Several stocks facing sector-specific disruptions (stablecoins, regulatory changes)\n4. High valuations in tech sector (MSFT PE 37.17, IBM PE 43.0)\n\nTechnical Analysis Highlights:\n- Strong momentum: GS (+7.9% 7-day), AXP (+7.2%), JPM (+6.2%), IBM (+6.0%)\n- Weak momentum: AMGN (-6.0% due to drug trial issues), UNH (-2.5%), MCD (-3.5%)\n- Stable patterns: HD, PG, HON, TRV\n\nFundamental Assessment:\n- Attractive valuations: JNJ (PE 18.75), UNH (PE 14.92), JPM (PE 15.3)\n- Stretched valuations: IBM (PE 43.0), MSFT (PE 37.17), CRM (PE 35.46)\n- Strong dividends: JNJ (294.3% yield), AMGN (340.95%), PG (277.33%)\n\nNews Catalysts:\n- Positive: Regulatory rollbacks for banks, AI partnerships, quantum computing developments\n- Negative: Weight-loss drug issues for AMGN, stablecoin disruption threat, consumer boycott concerns\n\nAllocation Strategy:\nWith only $457 cash available, need strategic rebalancing rather than new positions. Best opportunity is reducing AMGN (facing negative drug news, large 8% position) and reallocating to CRM (small position with AI catalysts). This maintains portfolio balance while responding to changing fundamentals.\n</THINK>\n\n<DECISION>\n{\n  \"decisions\": {\n    \"GS\": {\n      \"action\": \"hold\",\n      \"reasons\": [\n        \"Strong 7-day momentum from market_data.close_7d (+7.9% from 613.54 to 662.11)\",\n        \"Reasonable fundamental valuation with pe_ratio of 15.8 and solid dividend profile\",\n        \"Positive regulatory rollback news benefiting financial sector\",\n        \"Filter agent identified large position requiring fundamental risk assessment -
