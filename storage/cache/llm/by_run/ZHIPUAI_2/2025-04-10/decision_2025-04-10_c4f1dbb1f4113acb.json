Use comprehensive analysis combining technical, fundamental, and news data.\n\n- **Stocks WITHOUT fundamental_data**: These stocks were deemed suitable for technical analysis only. The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\"). Focus analysis on:\n  * Technical indicators and price patterns from market_data\n  * News sentiment and events from news_events  \n  * Position management and risk factors from position_state\n  * Historical decision consistency from history\n\n- **Filter Agent Reasoning**: The filter_reasoning field provides valuable context about the filtering decision.

heavily weighted in financials (GS, JPM), consumer discretionary (HD), and healthcare (JNJ, UNH)\n\nKey Risk Factors:\n1.

Pharma sector headwinds from Trump tariff threats (JNJ)\n5. Extreme volatility in several positions (CAT 18.1%, AAPL 23%, GS 17.9%)\n\nCash Allocation Strategy:\n- Must respect $24,817.28 cash limit\n- Prioritize defensive positions and reduce high-risk exposure\n- Focus on stocks with positive catalysts and reasonable valuations\n\nStock-by-Stock Analysis:\n\n**GS** - Extreme volatility (17.9%), ClearBridge institutional selling, financial recession concerns. Current position $2,062.71 (3.2% of portfolio). Despite reasonable PE (15.8) and high dividend (198.43%), technical weakness and institutional outflow warrant reduction.\n\n**MSFT** - Positive AI sector outlook, moderate 7.2% volatility.

Current $1,947.76. Reduce position given analyst concerns.\n\n**CAT** - UBS downgrade to Sell, 18.1% volatility, tariff impact concerns. Current $2,738.36. Significant reduction warranted given multiple headwinds.\n\n**MCD** - Stable 3.8% volatility, defensive consumer staple. Current $5,571.78. Increase position as defensive play.\n\n**UNH** - Strong 10.6% uptrend on CMS payment hike news. Current $2,587.85. Increase given positive catalyst.\n\n**AXP** - Normal 15.9% volatility, general economic concerns. Current $2,037.57. Hold current position.\n\n**AMGN** - Standard market correlation, 8.6% volatility. Current $5,540.74. Hold as healthcare diversification.\n\n**TRV** - Moderate 11.6% volatility, insurance sector stability. Current $3,068.33. Hold position.\n\n**CRM** - Positive insider activity (board member buying), 11.3% volatility. Current $1,955.20. Hold given insider confidence.\n\n**JPM** - 14.5% decline, sector downgrades, CEO geopolitical concerns. Current $3,788.10. Reduce given financial sector stress.\n\n**IBM** - Small 2.1% position, positive AI news. Current $1,395.24. Hold for AI exposure.\n\n**HON** - Moderate 15.4% volatility, general market underperformance. Current $4,335.75. Hold current position.\n\n**BA** - Closed position, no current exposure. Maintain closed status.\n\n**AMZN** - Moderate 12.9% volatility, tariff concerns. Current $2,861.34. Hold current position.\n\n**AAPL** - Extreme 23% volatility, tariff/China risks, UK privacy battle. Current $1,648.65. Reduce given multiple headwinds despite strong fundamentals.\n\n**PG** - Stable defensive pattern, dividend increase. Current $4,515.59. Increase as defensive staple.\n\n**JNJ** - Pharma tariff threats creating headwinds. Current $4,393.81. Hold despite tariff concerns due to defensive nature.\n\nCash Allocation Plan:\n- Total increases: MSFT (+$1,000), MCD (+$500), UNH (+$500), PG (+$500) = $2,500\n- Total decreases: GS (-$1,000), SHW
