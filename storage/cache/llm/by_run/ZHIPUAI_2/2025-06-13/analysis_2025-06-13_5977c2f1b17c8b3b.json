Impact Assessment:**\n- MCD: Multiple analyst downgrades citing GLP-1 drug impact on fast food sector - fundamental business model threat\n- UNH: Major fraud allegations and misconduct claims with 26.6% May decline - severe corporate governance issues\n- IBM: Quantum computing breakthrough announcements with all-time high prices - strategic technology developments\n- Other stocks have routine

Context:**\n- Most stocks show consistent \"hold\" patterns with stable confidence levels\n- No historical patterns indicating fundamental dependency for routine decisions\n- Recent position
