{"content": "\n<ANALYSIS>\n**Market Signals Analysis:**\n- Most stocks show normal volatility patterns within 2-3% ranges over 7 days\n- BA shows exceptional price movement: 11.8% jump from 159.32 to 178.11 with gap-up pattern\n- MSFT shows moderate 3.3% gain with stable upward momentum\n- No other stocks exhibit technical anomalies requiring fundamental validation\n\n**News Impact Assessment:**\n- BA: Material corporate events - fighter jet contract win and positive cash flow outlook represent fundamental business changes\n- MSFT: Multiple AI partnership developments (OpenAI, Meta with Reliance) could impact growth trajectory\n- GS, CAT, UNH: Insider buying mentions but not material corporate actions\n- Other stocks: Mostly analyst opinions, dividend updates, or general market commentary\n\n**Position Risk Analysis:**\n- Portfolio concentration: MSFT at 8.7% ($6,259) and JNJ at 8.3% ($5,958) are largest positions\n- MSFT's size combined with AI partnership news creates risk management consideration\n- BA has minimal position (near-zero) but news suggests potential re-entry opportunity\n- Most other positions are 3-7% of portfolio, within normal allocation limits\n\n**Historical Context:**\n- MSFT: Consistent hold pattern suggests confidence in position\n- BA: Zero position with recent holds indicates waiting for fundamental clarity\n- No historical patterns indicating fundamental dependency for other stocks\n- Recent trading actions (increases/decreases) don't suggest fundamental concerns\n\n**Fundamental Analysis Criteria Met:**\n- BA: Corporate action (major contract) + technical anomaly (gap-up)\n- MSFT: Large position + material business developments (AI partnerships)\n- Other stocks fail to meet specific criteria for fundamental analysis requirement\n</ANALYSIS>\n\n<FILTER_RESULT>\n{\n  \"stocks_need_fundamental\": [\"BA\", \"MSFT\"],\n  \"reasoning\": {\n    \"BA\": \"Material corporate event: major fighter jet contract win
