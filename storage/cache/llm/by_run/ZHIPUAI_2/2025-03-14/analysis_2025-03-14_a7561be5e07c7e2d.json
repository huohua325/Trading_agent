7 days, indicating unusual volatility requiring validation\n- AAPL shows 11.1% decline from 235.74 to 209.68, high volatility but routine news coverage\n- JPM shows 10.5% decline from 251.53 to 225.19, high volatility without clear catalyst\n- AXP shows 9.8% decline from 284.18 to 256.43, elevated volatility but routine coverage\n- Most other stocks show normal volatility patterns under 7%\n\nNews Impact Assessment:\n- GS: Major regulatory news about Fed appointee Bowman affecting bank oversight - requires fundamental validation of regulatory impact\n- MSFT: Routine quarterly dividend announcement - technical sufficient\n- CRM: $1B Singapore AI investment and airline partnership - strategic development requires fundamental assessment\n- HON: M&A activity and upcoming breakup complexity - fundamental validation needed\n- TRV: New product launch for life sciences - corporate development but price stable\n- UNH: Credit rating affirmation and security concerns - but minimal position size\n- BA: Trade war concerns and SpaceX missions - but position essentially closed\n\nPosition Risk Analysis:\n- Portfolio total: $94,533.61\n- Large positions requiring fundamental validation:\n  * AMGN: $6,968.97 (10.3% of portfolio)\n  * JNJ: $6,943.60 (10.2% of portfolio)\n  * MSFT: $6,011.84 (8.9% - under threshold)\n  * CAT: $5,400.14 (8.0% - under threshold)\n- Positions exceeding 10% threshold automatically require fundamental risk validation\n\nHistorical Context:\n- Most stocks show consistent decision patterns with confidence levels 0.7-0.86\n- GS, JPM, AAPL showing recent decreases suggest risk management mode\n- AMGN, JNJ recent decreases from larger positions indicate position sizing concerns\n- No clear historical fundamental dependency patterns detected\n\nPortfolio Concentration:\n- Two positions (AMGN, JNJ) exceed 10% individual allocation threshold\n- Combined they represent 20.5% of total portfolio value\n- This concentration requires fundamental justification for continued exposure\n</ANALYSIS>\n\n<FILTER_RESULT>\n{\n  \"stocks_need_fundamental\": [\"GS\", \"AMGN\", \"CRM\", \"HON\", \"JNJ\"],\n  \"reasoning\": {\n    \"GS\":
