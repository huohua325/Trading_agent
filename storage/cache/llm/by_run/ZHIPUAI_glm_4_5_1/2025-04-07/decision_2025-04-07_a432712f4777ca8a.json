assets: $90,091.72\n- Available cash: $17,044.73  \n- Position value: $73,046.99\n- Number of stocks: 22\n- Average allocation per stock: $90,091.72 / 22 = $4,095.08 (reference point)\n\n**Market Context Analysis:**\nFrom news and market data, there's significant market turmoil due to:\n- Trump tariffs triggering massive market selloff\n- Financial stocks experiencing biggest rout since 2023\n- Tech hardware companies heavily impacted by China tariffs\n- Dow and S&P 500 suffering substantial losses\n- Dealmaking freeze affecting investment banks\n\n**Technical Analysis (7-day trends):**\nMost stocks show significant declines:\n- BA: -23.7% (worst performer, aerospace)\n- GS: -15.8% (financials, COO appointment news)\n- JPM: -15.2% (financials, dealmaking freeze)\n- CAT: -15.1% (industrial, tariff sensitive)\n- AMZN: -15.1% (tech, hardware exposure)\n- AAPL: -15.8% (tech, China manufacturing exposure)\n- CRM: -13.3% (software, but AI growth story)\n- AXP: -14.1% (financials, shareholder proposals)\n\nMore defensive performers:\n- UNH: +1.8% (healthcare, only gainer)\n- PG: -2.9% (consumer staples)\n- HD: -2.4% (retail, strong dividend)\n- MCD: -4.0% (consumer discretionary, Cramer safety pick)\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n1. Systemic risk: Trade war and tariffs affecting broad market\n2. Sector risk: Financials and tech hardware most vulnerable\n3. Position risk: Some stocks heavily concentrated in affected sectors\n\n**Strategy:**\nGiven the market turmoil and limited cash, I'll:\n1. Focus on defensive sectors (healthcare, consumer staples)\n2. Selectively add to quality names with strong fundamentals\n3. Reduce exposure to most vulnerable sectors\n4. Maintain adequate cash buffer\n\n**Cash Allocation Plan:**\nAvailable cash: $17,044.73\nPlan to allocate to top 8-10 opportunities while maintaining safety buffer.\n\n**Decisions:**\n1. Increase defensive stocks (UNH, PG, JNJ, MCD, HD)\n2. Increase quality tech with cloud/AI exposure (MSFT, CRM, AMZN)\n3. Maintain positions in stable financials (V, AXP)\n4. Reduce most vulnerable (BA, GS, JPM, CAT)\n5. Hold others at current levels\n\n**Position Size Considerations:**\n- Target to keep individual positions under $6,000 for diversification\n- Average target around $4,000-$5,000 per position\n- Preserve cash for further opportunities\n</THINK>\n\n<DECISION>\n{\n  \"decisions\": {\n    \"GS\": {\n      \"action\": \"decrease\",\n      \"target_cash_amount\": 3500.0,\n      \"reasons\": [\n        \"Significant 15.8% decline in market_data.close_7d reflecting financial sector weakness\",\n        \"COO appointment news未能提振股价，显示执行风险\",\n        \"Financial stocks experiencing biggest rout since 2023 due to dealmaking freeze\",\n        \"Filter agent determined technical analysis sufficient -
