[{"message": {"content": "<ANALYSIS>\nMarket Signals Analysis:\n- GS shows significant volatility (8.1% drop over 7 days) with notable price swings from 617.77 to 567.67, indicating potential technical anomalies requiring fundamental validation.\n- UNH demonstrates strong upward momentum (5.2% increase) with a decisive price trend from 463.59 to 487.72, suggesting a potential valuation inflection point.\n- AXP exhibits high volatility (6.9% decline) with substantial price swings from 296.10 to 275.64, representing technical anomaly territory.\n- BA displays extreme volatility (8.4% drop) with significant price movement from 173.04 to 158.43, clearly in technical anomaly range.\n- AMZN shows considerable volatility (6.4% decline) with price movement from 214.35 to 200.70, approaching technical analysis reliability limits.\n- JPM experiences notable volatility (4.7% decline) with price swings from 258.79 to 246.54, warranting fundamental context.\n\nNews Impact Assessment:\n- GS has multiple fundamental catalysts: M&A leadership changes (Dubner named COO of global M&A), major acquisition activity ($19B Panama Canal ports purchase), and a critical analyst view suggesting the stock is \"in trouble.\"\n- UNH faces significant fundamental developments: a major legal victory in DOJ Medicare fraud lawsuit and concerns about federal budget cuts threatening growth.\n- HON reports corporate action news with the Sundyne acquisition to boost critical equipment portfolio, representing a fundamental business change.\n- BA is impacted by defense contract developments (US Navy fighter competition) and tariff concerns affecting industrials.\n- AMZN is mentioned in context of trading near \"multiple year P/E lows\" and facing tariff impacts, suggesting valuation considerations.\n\nPosition Risk Analysis:\n- Current portfolio positions are well-diversified with no single position exceeding 14% of portfolio value (AMGN at 13.9% being the largest).\n- Position holding periods are short (2 days for all holdings), reducing extended holding risk concerns.\n- No positions show concerning concentration that would independently trigger fundamental review requirements.\n\nHistorical Context:\n- Recent decision history shows consistent \"hold\" actions with moderate confidence levels (0.5-0.8).\n- No historical patterns indicating fundamental dependency for specific stocks.\n- Recent position initiations (HD, V, UNH, AXP, AMGN, TRV, PG, JNJ) were made within the last 2 days with standard technical analysis apparently sufficient.\n\nBased on the efficiency-first principle, fundamental analysis is only recommended for stocks showing clear technical anomalies combined with material fundamental news catalysts that cannot be adequately assessed through technical analysis alone.\n</ANALYSIS>\n\n<FILTER_RESULT>\n{\n  \"stocks_need_fundamental\": [\"GS\", \"UNH\", \"BA\", \"HON\", \"AMZN\"],\n  \"reasoning\": {\n    \"GS\": \"Technical anomaly
