Use comprehensive analysis combining technical, fundamental, and news data.\n\n- **Stocks WITHOUT fundamental_data**: These stocks were deemed suitable for technical analysis only. The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\"). Focus analysis on:\n  * Technical indicators and price patterns from market_data\n  * News sentiment and events from news_events  \n  * Position management and risk factors from position_state\n  * Historical decision consistency from history\n\n- **Filter Agent Reasoning**: The filter_reasoning field provides valuable context about the filtering decision. Consider this reasoning when making your final investment decision, as it reflects professional risk assessment about data requirements.\n</DUAL-AGENT CONTEXT>\n\n<OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS>\n1. <THINK>: Analysis process  \n   - Portfolio: Position distribution, risk diversification  \n   - Cash flow: Increases must be ≤ total_assets   \n   - **CRITICAL RESOURCE ALLOCATION**: \n     * Total available assets: {total_assets} - this is your HARD LIMIT\n     * Number of stocks to decide: {stock_count} - ensure balanced allocation\n     * Average allocation per stock: {total_assets/stock_count} - use as reference\n     * Never exceed total_assets in aggregate decisions\n   - Stocks: Adapt analysis depth based on available data\n     * **With fundamental_data**: Complete analysis using market_data, fundamental_data, news_events, position_state, and filter_reasoning\n     * **Without fundamental_data**: Focus on market_data patterns, news_events sentiment, position_state management, and filter_reasoning context\n     * Market Data: Price trends and momentum from market_data.close_7d, current price  \n     * Fundamental Indicators (when available): Valuation (pe_ratio), size (market_cap), income (dividend metrics), momentum (week_52 indicators)  \n     * News & Events: Sentiment and catalysts from news_events.top_k_events  \n   - Risk: Identify major risk factors, assess portfolio-wide  \n     * Technical risks: volatility, momentum breaks (from market_data)\n     * Fundamental risks (when available): valuation risk (high pe_ratio), momentum risk (week_52_high/low), size concentration  \n     * News risks: event-driven volatility\n   - Decision logic: Combine opportunities with cash limits and stock count constraints\n   - History: Maintain strategy consistency  \n   - Filter Context: Leverage filter_reasoning to understand analysis depth rationale\n   - Must cover ALL stocks, none can be skipped  \n\n2. <DECISION>:  \nFinal decision requirements:  \n- Output must be strictly valid JSON inside <DECISION> tags, all strings use double quotes, correct syntax, and no explanation/Markdown.  \n- Must provide a decision for every stock in the input symbols; no omissions, no additions. Even \"hold\" must be explicit with reasons.  \n- Must comply with cash requirements:  \n  1. Sum of all positive cash_change ≤ available_cash  \n     - System calculates cash_change = target_cash_amount - current_position_value  \n     - If cash_change > 0, it consumes available_cash  \n  2. **TOTAL ASSETS CONSTRAINT**: Sum of all target_cash_amount ≤ total_assets\n     - This is the absolute maximum you can allocate across all positions\n     - Consider stock count: with {stock_count} stocks, average allocation should be ~{total_assets/stock_count}\n     - Avoid over-concentration in single positions\n  3.
