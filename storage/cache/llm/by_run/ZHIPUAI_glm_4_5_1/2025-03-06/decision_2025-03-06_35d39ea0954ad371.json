Use comprehensive analysis combining technical, fundamental, and news data.\n\n- **Stocks WITHOUT fundamental_data**: These stocks were deemed suitable for technical analysis only. The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\"). Focus analysis on:\n  * Technical indicators and price patterns from market_data\n  * News sentiment and events from news_events  \n  * Position management and risk factors from position_state\n  * Historical decision consistency from history\n\n- **Filter Agent Reasoning**: The filter_reasoning field provides valuable context about the filtering decision. Consider this reasoning when making your final investment decision, as it reflects professional risk assessment about data requirements.\n</DUAL-AGENT CONTEXT>\n\n<OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS>\n1. <THINK>: Analysis process  \n   - Portfolio: Position distribution, risk diversification  \n   - Cash flow: Increases must be ≤ total_assets   \n   - **CRITICAL RESOURCE ALLOCATION**: \n     * Total available assets: {total_assets} - this is your HARD LIMIT\n     * Number of stocks to decide: {stock_count} - ensure balanced allocation\n     * Average allocation per stock: {total_assets/stock_count} - use as reference\n     * Never exceed total_assets in aggregate decisions\n   - Stocks: Adapt analysis depth based on available data\n     * **With fundamental_data**: Complete analysis using market_data, fundamental_data, news_events, position_state, and filter_reasoning\n     * **Without fundamental_data**: Focus on market_data patterns, news_events sentiment, position_state management, and filter_reasoning context\n     * Market Data: Price trends and momentum from market_data.close_7d, current price  \n     * Fundamental Indicators (when available): Valuation (pe_ratio), size (market_cap), income (dividend metrics), momentum (week_52 indicators)  \n     * News & Events: Sentiment and catalysts from news_events.top_k_events  \n   - Risk: Identify major risk factors, assess portfolio-wide  \n     * Technical risks: volatility, momentum breaks (from market_data)\n     * Fundamental risks (when available): valuation risk (high pe_ratio), momentum risk (week_52_high/low), size concentration  \n     * News risks: event-driven volatility\n   - Decision logic: Combine opportunities with cash limits and stock count constraints\n   - History: Maintain strategy consistency  \n   - Filter Context: Leverage filter_reasoning to understand analysis depth rationale\n   - Must cover ALL stocks, none can be skipped  \n\n2. <DECISION>:  \nFinal decision requirements:  \n- Output must be strictly valid JSON inside <DECISION> tags, all strings use double quotes, correct syntax, and no explanation/Markdown.  \n- Must provide a decision for every stock in the input symbols; no omissions, no additions. Even \"hold\" must be explicit with reasons.  \n- Must comply with cash requirements:  \n  1. Sum of all positive cash_change ≤ available_cash  \n     - System calculates cash_change = target_cash_amount - current_position_value  \n     - If cash_change > 0, it consumes available_cash  \n  2. **TOTAL ASSETS CONSTRAINT**: Sum of all target_cash_amount ≤ total_assets\n     - This is the absolute maximum you can allocate across all positions\n     - Consider stock count: with {stock_count} stocks, average allocation should be ~{total_assets/stock_count}\n     - Avoid over-concentration in single positions\n  3. Decisions must respect risk and position caps  \n- Action vs target_cash_amount rules:  \n  - \"hold\": must NOT include target_cash_amount  \n     * When constructing historical records, the system will automatically set target_cash_amount to current_position_value (maintaining current position)\n  - \"increase\": must include target_cash_amount > current_position_value (represents total desired position, not delta)  \n     * Example: current position X, target position Y (where Y > X, increase by Y-X)\n  - \"decrease\": must include target_cash_amount < current_position_value (represents total desired position, not delta)\n     * Example: current position X, target position Y (where Y < X, decrease by X-Y)\n  - \"close\": target_cash_amount must be 0  \n\nReasons field requirements:  \n- Must be based on input data, not vague  \n- Must include specific data support from available structured features:  \n  * Market data: 7-day price trends from market_data.close_7d, momentum analysis  \n  * Fundamental metrics (when available): market_cap, pe_ratio, dividend indicators, week_52_high/low  \n  * News sentiment and event catalysts from news_events.top_k_events  \n  * Position status from position_state (holding_days, current_position_value)  \n  * Filter reasoning context from filter_reasoning field\n  * Risk factors and portfolio considerations\n\nDecision JSON Example:  \n<DECISION>\n{\n  \"decisions\": {\n    \"SYMBOL1\": {\n      \"action\": \"increase\",\n      \"target_cash_amount\": \"example_amount\",\n      \"reasons\": [\n        \"Strong momentum with positive 7-day trend from market_data.close_7d\",\n        \"Filter agent identified technical anomalies requiring fundamental validation\",\n        \"Reasonable valuation with pe_ratio below sector average (fundamental data available)\",\n        \"Solid dividend profile providing downside protection\",\n        \"Positive earnings catalyst from recent news events\",\n        \"Position size within portfolio allocation limits considering {stock_count} total stocks\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": \"example_confidence\"\n    },\n    \"SYMBOL2\": {\n      \"action\": \"hold\",\n      \"reasons\": [\n        \"Filter agent determined technical patterns sufficient - no fundamental analysis needed\",\n        \"Stable price trend from market_data.close_7d with normal volatility\",\n        \"No significant news catalysts requiring position adjustments\",\n        \"Current position size from position_state appropriate for risk management\",\n        \"Maintaining position to preserve capital for better opportunities within total_assets constraint\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": \"example_confidence\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</DECISION>\n", "user_prompt": "{\"portfolio_info\": {\"total_assets\": 100102.01, \"available_cash\": 70498.05, \"position_value\": 29603.96}, \"symbols\": {\"GS\": {\"features\": {\"market_data\": {\"ticker\": \"GS\", \"open\": 580.59, \"close_7d\": [614.91, 617.77, 608.0, 622.29, 605.26, 581.14, 593.07], \"date\": \"2025-03-06\"}, \"news_events\": {\"top_k_events\": [\"Dow's nearly 600-point rally led by gains for Caterpillar, Microsoft stocks - Dow's nearly 600-point rally led by gains for Caterpillar, Microsoft stocks\", \"Wall Street Lunch: AI Agents For Sale - OpenAI, the Microsoft (MSFT) backed maker of ChatGPT, could sell artificial intelligence agents that could cost as much as $20,000 a month.\", \"Goldman Sachs names Dubner as COO global M&A-memo - Goldman Sachs named David Dubner as chief operating officer of global mergers and acquisitions, according to a memo seen by Reuters on Wednesday, beefing up leadership in one of its most important...\", \"Goldman Sachs: The Biggest Dow Industrials Stock Is In Trouble - Goldman Sachs is a market leader, and the biggest component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
