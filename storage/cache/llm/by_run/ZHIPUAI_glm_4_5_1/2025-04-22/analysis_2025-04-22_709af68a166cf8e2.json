requiring fundamental validation\n- MSFT: Jim Cramer's specific warning about Azure acceleration and 380 floor level suggests business fundamentals concern\n- CRM: Analyst downgrades despite AI Agentforce push, plus insider selling of $13M indicates potential fundamental weakness\n- AMZN: Multiple tariff war impact articles and urgent moves to avoid trade war effects suggest business model vulnerability\n- BA: Direct tariff war impact on Chinese airline deliveries creates fundamental business risk\n- HD: Trump meeting with retail leaders on tariff impacts creates sector-wide fundamental

positions are within normal allocation limits (2-7% range)\n- Extended holding periods (25-34 days) across portfolio suggest need for periodic fundamental review\n\nHistorical Context:\n- Recent decrease actions in MSFT, JPM, AAPL, AMGN, HON, BA indicate position management concerns\n- Multiple hold decisions with moderate confidence (0.5-0.6) suggest uncertainty requiring fundamental clarity\n- No clear pattern of fundamental dependency in historical decisions\n\nPortfolio Concentration:\n- Well-diversified across 22 stocks with no excessive concentration beyond JPM's 7.4%\n-
