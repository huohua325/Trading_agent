requirements based on market signals, news impact, position risk, and historical context.\n\n**Market Signals Analysis:**\n- GS shows 5.5% decline with high volatility, BA shows 7% decline, AMZN shows 5.5% decline, JNJ shows 6.2% volatility - these technical anomalies require fundamental validation\n- Most other stocks show stable patterns within normal ranges\n\n**News Impact Assessment:**\n- GS: Major economic outlook change (recession probability to 35%), significant insider selling activity\n- MSFT: $40B OpenAI funding round where Microsoft is key strategic investor\n- CAT: Trump tariff policy potentially benefiting industrial reshoring\n- JPM: Earnings-related commentary affecting banking sector\n- BA: Multiple significant corporate events (astronaut saga, $2.46B Air Force contract, 50-jet order)\n- AMZN: Major AI agent development challenging OpenAI\n- AAPL: Significant AI product upgrades and EU expansion\n- PG: Potential fundamental outlook downgrade due to weak demand trends\n\n**Position Risk Management:**\n- Large positions (>6% portfolio): GS (6.9%), MSFT (7%), UNH (6.8%), JPM (6.6%), AMZN (6%)\n- These larger positions require fundamental justification for continued exposure\n\n**Historical Context:**\n- Recent position increases in GS, MSFT, CAT, UNH, AXP, JPM, BA with high confidence (0.65-0.75) suggest these are strategic holdings requiring fundamental validation\n- Consistent hold patterns for most other stocks indicate routine management\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n8 stocks require fundamental analysis due to combination of technical
