Use comprehensive analysis combining technical, fundamental, and news data.\n\n- **Stocks WITHOUT fundamental_data**: These stocks were deemed suitable for technical analysis only. The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\"). Focus analysis on:\n  * Technical indicators and price patterns from market_data\n  * News sentiment and events from news_events  \n  * Position management and risk factors from position_state\n  * Historical decision consistency from history\n\n- **Filter Agent Reasoning**: The filter_reasoning field provides valuable context about the filtering decision.

attention to cash constraints and risk management. Let me break down the analysis:\n\n**Portfolio Overview:**\n- Total assets: $101,802.37 (hard limit for all positions)\n- Available cash: $17,399.79\n- Current position value: $84,402.58\n- Number of stocks: 20\n- Average allocation per stock: $5,090.12\n\n**Key Analysis Framework:**\nSince all stocks have \"technical analysis sufficient\" filter reasoning, I'll focus on market trends, news sentiment, position management, and portfolio balance.\n\n**Market Trend Analysis:**\n- Strong momentum (>5% weekly gain): GS (6.3%), AXP (5.6%), JPM (7.4%), BA (12.8%), AMZN (5.1%), AAPL (4.6%)\n- Moderate momentum (2-5% weekly gain): V (3.0%), UNH (2.9%), CRM (2.8%)\n- Weak/flat trend: MSFT (1.7%), HD (1.9%), CAT (flat), MCD (1.0%), HON (0.8%)\n- Negative trend: SHW (-0.3%), AMGN (-3.3%), TRV (-2.1%), IBM (-1.2%), PG (-4.1%), JNJ (-1.1%)\n\n**Position Allocation Analysis:**\n- Above average allocation: GS ($6,137), UNH ($5,502), JPM ($5,661), AMZN ($5,346)\n- Close to average: CAT ($4,536), CRM ($4,325), BA ($5,014), AAPL ($4,175)\n- Below average: MSFT ($5,992), V ($3,944), SHW ($3,020), AXP ($4,068), AMGN ($3,947), TRV ($3,565), IBM ($3,980), HON ($3,017), MCD ($3,230), PG ($2,454), JNJ ($3,431), HD ($3,060)\n\n**News Sentiment Analysis:**\n- Strong positive: GS (Cramer recommendation), HD (Cramer \"BUY\"), CRM (AI upside, Goldman recommendation), IBM (AI opportunity), PG (dividend champion)\n- Moderate positive: MSFT (Goldman recommendation), V (Dalio recommendation), MCD (defensive safety), JPM (undervalued dividend), AMZN (AI opportunity), AAPL (AI investment)\n- Neutral/mixed: CAT (equipment borrowings down), AXP (consumer spending concerns), HON (tariff relief)\n- Negative: UNH (DOJ investigation), AMGN (pharma tariff concerns), BA (legal issues), SHW (underperformed), TRV (underperformed), JNJ (minimal news)\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- High risk: UNH (DOJ investigation), BA (legal uncertainty)\n- Moderate risk: AMGN (sector tariff concerns), CAT (equipment borrowings down)\n- Lower risk: HD, MCD, PG, JNJ (defensive/dividend stocks)\n\n**Portfolio Strategy:**\nGiven the available cash of $17,399.79 and average allocation of $5,090, I need to:\n1. Increase positions with strong catalysts and below-average allocation\n2. Decrease positions with significant risks and above-average allocation\n3. Maintain portfolio balance and diversification\n\n**Resource Allocation Plan:**\n- Target increases for undervalued stocks with positive catalysts\n- Focus on stocks below average allocation with strong fundamentals\n- Reduce overexposed positions with elevated risk\n- Maintain cash buffer for future opportunities\n\n**Specific Decisions:**\n1. Increase HD, V, MCD, CRM, IBM, PG, JNJ (below average, positive catalysts)\n2. Decrease UNH (above average, legal risk)\n3.
