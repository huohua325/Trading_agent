fundamental validation\n- AXP exhibits 11.3% volatility with sharp decline from $284.18 to $255.39, representing technical breakdown pattern\n- AAPL and BA show high volatility (>10%) but no current positions, so monitoring without fundamental analysis is sufficient\n- Most other stocks show moderate volatility (4-8%) within normal trading ranges\n\nNews Impact Assessment:\n- GS: CEO IPO expectations and managing director departure represent corporate events requiring fundamental context\n- UNH: Rosen Law investigation of fiduciary duty breaches is material legal news requiring fundamental risk assessment\n- AXP: Trump tariff policy causing recession fears impacts financial sector fundamentals\n- CRM: $1B Singapore expansion and AI Agentforce traction represent significant strategic investments\n- HON: M&A activities ahead of corporate break-up create fundamental uncertainty\n- MSFT dividend announcement is routine corporate action, not requiring fundamental analysis\n\nPosition Risk Analysis:\n- Current positions range from 6.0% (UNH) to 9.7% (AMGN) of portfolio - all within reasonable allocation limits\n- New positions (CAT, MCD, CRM, HON) added yesterday require fundamental validation for entry decisions\n- Extended holding positions (6 days for HD, V, UNH, AXP, AMGN, TRV, PG, JNJ) show normal position management\n\nPortfolio Concentration:\n- Portfolio well-diversified with 11 positions, largest being AMGN at 9.7%\n- No concentration concerns requiring fundamental justification\n\nHistorical Context:\n- History shows consistent technical-based decision making with confidence levels 0.5-0.8\n- No previous patterns indicating fundamental dependency for routine decisions\n- Recent decreases in UNH and AXP suggest risk management considerations\n</ANALYSIS>\n\n<FILTER_RESULT>\n{\n  \"stocks_need_fundamental\": [\"GS\", \"UNH\", \"AXP\", \"CRM\", \"HON\"],\n  \"reasoning\": {\n    \"GS\": \"High 11.6% volatility
