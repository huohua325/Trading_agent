Use comprehensive analysis combining technical, fundamental, and news data.\n\n- **Stocks WITHOUT fundamental_data**: These stocks were deemed suitable for technical analysis only. The filter_reasoning explains why fundamental data was excluded (e.g., \"Technical pattern sufficient\", \"Normal volatility range\"). Focus analysis on:\n  * Technical indicators and price patterns from market_data\n  * News sentiment and events from news_events  \n  * Position management and risk factors from position_state\n  * Historical decision consistency from history\n\n- **Filter Agent Reasoning**: The filter_reasoning field provides valuable context about the filtering decision. Consider this reasoning when making your final investment decision, as it reflects professional risk assessment about data requirements.\n</DUAL-AGENT CONTEXT>\n\n<OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS>\n1. <THINK>: Analysis process  \n   - Portfolio: Position distribution, risk diversification  \n   - Cash flow: Increases must be ≤ total_assets   \n   - **CRITICAL RESOURCE ALLOCATION**: \n     * Total available assets: {total_assets} - this is your HARD LIMIT\n     * Number of stocks to decide: {stock_count} - ensure balanced allocation\n     * Average allocation per stock: {total_assets/stock_count} - use as reference\n     * Never exceed total_assets in aggregate decisions\n   - Stocks: Adapt analysis depth based on available data\n     * **With fundamental_data**: Complete analysis using market_data, fundamental_data, news_events, position_state, and filter_reasoning\n     * **Without fundamental_data**: Focus on market_data patterns, news_events sentiment, position_state management, and filter_reasoning context\n     * Market Data: Price trends and momentum from market_data.close_7d, current price  \n     * Fundamental Indicators (when available): Valuation (pe_ratio), size (market_cap), income (dividend metrics), momentum (week_52 indicators)  \n     * News & Events: Sentiment and catalysts from news_events.top_k_events  \n   - Risk: Identify major risk factors, assess portfolio-wide  \n     * Technical risks: volatility, momentum breaks (from market_data)\n     * Fundamental risks (when available): valuation risk (high pe_ratio), momentum risk (week_52_high/low), size concentration  \n     * News risks: event-driven volatility\n   - Decision logic: Combine opportunities with cash limits and stock count constraints\n   - History: Maintain strategy consistency  \n   - Filter Context: Leverage filter_reasoning to understand analysis depth rationale\n   - Must cover ALL stocks, none can be skipped  \n\n2. <DECISION>:  \nFinal decision requirements:  \n- Output must be strictly valid JSON inside <DECISION> tags, all strings use double quotes, correct syntax, and no explanation/Markdown.  \n- Must provide a decision for every stock in the input symbols; no omissions, no additions. Even \"hold\" must be explicit with reasons.  \n- Must comply with cash requirements:  \n  1. Sum of all positive cash_change ≤ available_cash  \n     - System calculates cash_change = target_cash_amount - current_position_value  \n     - If cash_change > 0, it consumes available_cash  \n  2. **TOTAL ASSETS CONSTRAINT**: Sum of all target_cash_amount ≤ total_assets\n     - This is the absolute maximum you can allocate across all positions\n     - Consider stock count: with {stock_count} stocks, average allocation should be ~{total_assets/stock_count}\n     - Avoid over-concentration in single positions\n  3.

$49,993.47, with total assets amounting to $99,866.15. The investment strategy requires balancing between existing holdings and potential new positions across multiple stocks.\n\n- **Cash flow**: The portfolio's total assets allow for strategic investments but must remain within the available cash. Significant allocations will be made while respecting these limits.\n\n- **CRITICAL RESOURCE ALLOCATION**: \n  - Total available assets: $99,866.15\n  - Number of stocks to decide: 20\n  - Average allocation per stock: $4,993.31\n  - Decisions must not exceed total assets of $99,866.15.\n\n- **Stocks**:\n  - **With fundamental_data**: GS, BA, AAPL\n    - **GS**: Current position shows a downward trend after the peak. The recent news highlighting trouble for Goldman Sachs indicates a need for caution. With a PE ratio of 15.8 and significant market cap, there's value but must be monitored closely.\n    - **BA**: Price volatility and competitive pressure are considerable with recent news. Though foundational health appears strong with a market cap over $162 billion, the need for deeper evaluation warrants a smaller increase or a hold.\n    - **AAPL**: Not only is the volatility substantial, but the PE ratio indicates rich valuations. Expected improvements in fundamentals are projected but current observations warrant holding.\n  \n  - **Without fundamental_data**: other stocks to consider.\n    - **MSFT**, **HD**, **V**, **SHW**, **CAT**, **MCD**, **UNH**, **AXP**, **AMGN**, **TRV**, **CRM**, **JPM**, **IBM**, **HON**, **AMZN**, **PG**, **JNJ**.\n    - The majority of these exhibit stable market indicators, with news indicating support for slight investments in growth stocks like **MSFT** and **V**, given their positive news backgrounds and stable price movements.\n\n- **Risk**: The major risks include increasing exposure in volatile stocks like GS and BA, which shows mixed signs. Stocks without current positions, particularly those with stable performance, may benefit from small investments.\n\n- **Position Management**: The lack of positions across multiple stocks creates a broader risk landscape. Implementing small investments into preferred stocks while maintaining large cash reserves may bolster future flexibility.\n\n- **History**: There are no historical decisions recorded, hence no prior strategies or consistencies to leverage.\n\n- **Filter Context**: The distinction between technical and fundamental analyses across the stock pool has clarified which stocks require deeper fundamental investigations and allowed for targeted investments based on risk assessments.\n</THINK>\n\n<DECISION>\n{\n  \"decisions\": {\n    \"GS\": {\n      \"action\": \"hold\",\n      \"reasons\": [\n
